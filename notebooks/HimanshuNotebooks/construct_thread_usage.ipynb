       " 'A lot of the internet attorneys on here need to give up their “licenses” to practice internet law. \\n\\nThere are plenty of credible resources regarding employment and HIPPA on the internet. Especially where the info is specific to doctor’s excuses. Go to those resources instead of these faceless, credential lacking, unregulated internet lawyers for your guidance.\\n\\nI’ll suggest looking at the sites of law firms that specialize in employment law and sick leave rights. When those attorneys say “The HIPAA privacy rule states that an employer may request a doctor’s note from an employee, but only if it is necessary for an acceptable reason, like sick leave, Workers’ Compensation, or health insurance.”, it tells you that responses suggesting  employers can’t require a doctors excuse are wrong. It could possibly still be contrary to a company’s internal policy, but that still doesn’t make it illegal.\\n\\nIn my place of employment, the doctor’s excuses need only read that “Mr. Smith was seen in my office for illness or treatment and can return to work on this date with or without these restrictions”. If there are no restrictions, you’re allowed back to work. If there are restrictions, if the job you do can accommodate those restrictions, then you can come back to work. If we cannot accommodate those restrictions,  you can’t return to work until those restrictions are lifted. Which also means a return to the doctor to provide the statement saying no restrictions. And that only means time off with pay if you have the PTO to burn. If you don’t, you are off in an unpaid status. And in all of this, we obtain no information that violates HIPPA.\\n\\nOne thing to note is that if you don’t have the PTO and you aren’t in a protected status such as FMLA, you can be terminated for excessive absences. The loss of  a minimum wage job in a job rich environment may not be a big deal to a lot of people, but job history and a previous employer saying nothing more than “ineligible for rehire” may impact your ability to replace that job or to get a position that is actually a well paying job down the road.\\n\\nAnd who came up with or approved  these policies? Attorneys licensed to practice law in our State. Not some yahoo practicing internet law.',\n",
