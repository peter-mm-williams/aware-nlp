       "'Entering my third year of employment with fed gov. Overall I’m glad I switched from private sector, it’s been what I had hoped and I plan to stay a fed gov employee until retirement.\\n\\nHere’s the rub: I love the work I do but I’m beginning to hate my job more with each passing week. Specifically, I have an overbearing supervisor who was hired several months ago from the private sector, and while this individual is a decent, well meaning person (I think), they’ve been steadily morphing into an egomaniac and their proclivity for bringing their apparent 35 years of private sector management style to bear on me and other fellow subordinates is becoming increasingly intolerable by the week.\\n\\nToday we had a face to face, one on one and I was left with the impression that one of my coworkers/fellow subordinates is being targeted for discipline/write up of a Performance Improvement Plan so they can be micromanaged by this supervisor even more closely and that much easier to either discipline formally and/or fire.\\n\\nThis supervisor started insinuating that they’re thinking of initiating the same with me and all my other coworkers/subordinates who are in the same role (about 8 of us) via a couple of offhand comments on their part: for example they said, “in the meeting minutes I took back on Nov xx, it’s written right here that you said in our planning meeting you were working on xxx, yet here we are a month later and you’re just now finishing xxx up.”\\n\\nThe meeting began to feel very litigious at that point moving forward to the level that this supervisor started asking me to send her emails I mentioned that would demonstrate why I was delayed -several competing priorities kept surfacing that in my judgement any reasonable person would agree did take precedence in those moments over the past month- and if I could successfully locate them and forward them to her then she wouldn’t have to bring up her concern that I’ve been chronically late producing xxx to her laterals and higher ups. Yuck: the whole thing today was just gross.\\n\\nI’m feeling very threatened and want to start taking as many precautions and protections from any tyranny blossoming into reality on the horizon as possible. I’ve had one other terribly tyrannical micromanaging supervisor in my career this far and I’d prefer to just increase as much buffer distance as I can from this supervisor in order to just not be on their radar…and absent that as a viable strategy, would like to be aware of what options for preparing to cover my ass should they start monitoring my every move/email/conversation with the intent of finding circumstances which they’ll readily be able to think “gotcha, that is the dirt I’ve been waiting to find to use against you!”\\n\\nLike, is there a repository of info a link away in the OPM site?\\n\\nWhere might I go to start drilling into the information I need so I can be aware of my rights/option in this supervisor-subordinate relationship?\\n\\nSources?'"
