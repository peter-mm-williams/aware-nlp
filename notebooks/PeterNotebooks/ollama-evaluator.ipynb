Here are my opinions on the current state of Best Buy:\\n\\n1. Competition: Best Buy faces intense competition from other retailers such as Amazon, Walmart, and Target, which offer similar products at lower prices. To stay competitive, Best Buy needs to focus on providing excellent customer service, offering unique product combinations, and maintaining a seamless online shopping experience.\\n2. Product mix: Best Buy's product mix is diverse, ranging from consumer electronics (e.g., TVs, smartphones, laptops) to home appliances (e.g., refrigerators, washing machines, dishwashers). While this diversification can provide stability during economic fluctuations, it also increases the complexity of managing product offerings and supply chains.\\n3. Online presence: Best Buy's online platform is a significant strength, allowing customers to browse and purchase products from the comfort of their own homes. However, the company needs to continue investing in its e-commerce capabilities to stay ahead of the competition.\\n4. Geographical footprint: With over 1,000 stores across the United States, Best Buy has a strong geographical presence. This physical footprint provides customers with easy access to products and services, but also increases operational costs such as rent, utilities, and labor expenses.\\n5. Price sensitivity: Consumers are increasingly price-sensitive, and Best Buy needs to be mindful of this when setting product prices. The company must balance profit margins with customer demand for affordable products.\\n6. Product innovation: As technology continues to advance, Best Buy needs to stay at the forefront of product innovation. This includes offering cutting-edge products, such as smart home devices and virtual reality experiences, while also providing education and support to customers.\\n7. Sustainability: Consumers are becoming more environmentally conscious, and Best Buy should prioritize sustainable practices in its operations and product offerings. This could include reducing packaging waste, using eco-friendly materials, and offering energy-efficient products.\\n8. Employee engagement: Best Buy's success depends on the dedication and expertise of its employees. The company should prioritize employee training, development, and engagement to ensure that customers receive exceptional service and support.\\n9. Supply chain management: Best Buy relies on a complex network of suppliers and manufacturers to source its products. The company must maintain strong relationships with these partners while also ensuring the timely delivery of products to meet customer demand.\\n10. Financial performance: Best Buy has faced challenges in recent years, including declining sales and profitability. To address these issues, the company needs to focus on optimizing its pricing strategies, improving supply chain efficiency, and investing in growth areas such as e-commerce and new product categories.\\n\\nOverall, Best Buy has a strong foundation as a leading retailer of consumer electronics and appliances. However, the company needs to stay adaptable and responsive to changing market trends, customer preferences, and technological innovations to remain competitive and profitable in the long term.\"}\n"

      "Statement: Well, I worked there for 4 years. 3 of being in the highest ranked sales position in the company (MDC/System Designer) my reasons were pretty well the same grievances company wide. My reasons were compounded by favoritism and sexual harassment. Note** MDC was 100% commission based. You could make ALOT of money if you’re a closer (I am, was one of the top network designers in the country)  Best Buy recently made the largest restructuring they’ve had in over a decade. This roll out was through the pandemic and VERY ROUGH.   They went from hourly, specialized departments to hourly+commission store wide sales consultants. Meaning the sales people had to step out of their “comfort zone” and learn other parts of the store they were not familiar with. This new business model included in-home “Sr. Sales Consultants” that would advise customers in their homes. On paper and in theory this is a smart move. A personal touch higher paid sales people that are more knowledgeable.   The problem with that is there are only a few guys skilled enough to do these roles and worked mainly on the MDC department along with a handful of Best Buy “In home advisors” which were just more entry-level system designers. When they rolled everything out they stripped the majority system designers of their titles, made them focus on lesser products and learn the entire store. And high end or high level jobs would go to the 1 or 2 designers that would then take on everyone’s workload.   It was stressful as hell It was demoralizing being stripped of a prestigious title. It made us feel like a number in a machine  I personally was offered a pay cut and they tried to make me feel excited about it. (Most got raises, more on that later.) THEN MADE ME WORK MORE! The rest of the store basically got pay raises and demoted. It’s what it felt like. Payed more to eat more shit.  They stopped caring about the things that made the work place fun and focused heavily on subscription based services (TTS) and coached primarily on that. And getting credit cards. The important managers (GM/SSM) are rarely in the store to address concerns and the company has them hide behind a computer all day doing other things.  They are turning more stores into just warehouses, the staff is trained to hand the customer off to a sales consultant or sr sales consultant. So it makes the worker feel less important. A lot of people are taking pay cuts to leave. In my store alone I can name 6 off the top of my head and more looking for other work. ALL of which where the best employees in the store.   My store went from 7 to 2 designers. One of which was a “straight” man who asked me to have sex with his wife while he watched. Turns out he’s also both gay and straight. He’s had multiple sexual harassment accusations. Our store had a new GM take our store over and right before the switch. This GM had known the gay cuck for “years” Turns out he’s doing the interviews. Again, I was one of the top networking designers in the country, but he sold more TVs and sound-bars than me. I made the company more money, he sold more entry level product.   They promoted the gay cuck  Try to get me to hand my clients over to him.  My clients were CEOs, Lawyers, Real-estate investors. They were loyal to me. Repeat clients   His customer was a kid who’s parents own a small phone repair store that bought brackets and entry level TVs from him.   Best Buy is a who you know - blunt force object that pushed all their skilled workers out because they think they don’t need them. The majority of their money comes from online purchases.   I used to like working there and my experience alllll the way up until the end was mostly positive.\n",

It’s been quite the experience over the last 20 months. The people I’ve worked with, especially in product flow are some of the funniest, most hard-working people I’ve ever known, and I was honored and privileged to work alongside them.   With that being said, Best Buy, as a corporation, is completely and utterly fucked. Starting at the top, Cori Berri is one of the worst executives I’ve ever heard of. She constantly takes this company and drives it into the ground. It almost seems intentional at this point. She is a fucking idiot and I wouldn’t trust her to run a lemonade stand, let alone a huge corporation.   To one of my managers in particular, you are an asshole. Plain and simple. You constantly call people out over the walkie for stupid things, knowing damn well that it could’ve been a 1on1 conversation, or one that didn’t need to occur in the first place. Instead, you sit on your ass or stand at the AP and belittle people. Idgaf how long you’ve worked there, you’re a dick and I hope you eat shit. You constantly bring morale down throughout the store and then wonder why people don’t have good attitudes.  To the managers, STOP INTERRUPTING CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN SALES FLOOR AND CUSTOMERS. It has to be the most deflating thing in the world when you’re having a good conversation with a customer, selling them product, learning about them and their interests, and then hearing over the walkie, “oo (salesperson’s name), looks like a good membership opportunity”. I hear that and I can feel the balloon being deflated. Fuck your stupid memberships, fuck your stupid credit cards, 99% of customers don’t want it and you make the interactions worse by shoving it down their throats.   With that, Best Buy needs to bring back specialization. One of the biggest complaints that customers have is that “your sales floor doesn’t know shit about the product.” Well, how could they? Best Buy wants sales floor to be experts on thousands of products. You know what happens when you try to be an expert on everything? You’re an expert on nothing. It’s simply impossible. Best Buy is trying so hard to suck customer’s dicks and yet, is actively pushing them away every single day.   All in all, I’m predicting that Best Buy will not make it to 2030. I hope I’m wrong because workers at Best Buy need jobs. But unfortunately, I see Best Buy following the footsteps of KMart straight to bankruptcy. The board needs to get Cori as far away as possible from Best Buy.   Best of luck,  Former Product Flow Specialist\n",

Plus best buy looks good as a stepping stone for your resume. Don't think it gets better because it won't. Maybe 6 years ago it was better, but the new version and direction isn't worth the stress. Look around you, if the seasoned staff and veterans are leaving it should be a clear indicator that it's a lost cause. Don't let best buy burn you out or change you as a person for the sake of sales goals.  Best Buy has 0 concern about employee retention. Just credit card apps,TTS and NPS. All factors that affect achievers and leadership bonuses. Not the individuals doing the work. You do everything and get nothing while the leaders get everything.  Get out when you can.\n",

      "Statement: Let Go Today; I was informed today that I was being terminated due to attendance violations. (Being late, not calling out or no call no showing). It’s been quite the experience over the last 20 months. The people I’ve worked with, especially in product flow are some of the funniest, most hard-working people I’ve ever known, and I was honored and privileged to work alongside them.   With that being said, Best Buy, as a corporation, is completely and utterly fucked. Starting at the top, Cori Berri is one of the worst executives I’ve ever heard of. She constantly takes this company and drives it into the ground. It almost seems intentional at this point. She is a fucking idiot and I wouldn’t trust her to run a lemonade stand, let alone a huge corporation.   To one of my managers in particular, you are an asshole. Plain and simple. You constantly call people out over the walkie for stupid things, knowing damn well that it could’ve been a 1on1 conversation, or one that didn’t need to occur in the first place. Instead, you sit on your ass or stand at the AP and belittle people. Idgaf how long you’ve worked there, you’re a dick and I hope you eat shit. You constantly bring morale down throughout the store and then wonder why people don’t have good attitudes.  To the managers, STOP INTERRUPTING CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN SALES FLOOR AND CUSTOMERS. It has to be the most deflating thing in the world when you’re having a good conversation with a customer, selling them product, learning about them and their interests, and then hearing over the walkie, “oo (salesperson’s name), looks like a good membership opportunity”. I hear that and I can feel the balloon being deflated. Fuck your stupid memberships, fuck your stupid credit cards, 99% of customers don’t want it and you make the interactions worse by shoving it down their throats.   With that, Best Buy needs to bring back specialization. One of the biggest complaints that customers have is that “your sales floor doesn’t know shit about the product.” Well, how could they? Best Buy wants sales floor to be experts on thousands of products. You know what happens when you try to be an expert on everything? You’re an expert on nothing. It’s simply impossible. Best Buy is trying so hard to suck customer’s dicks and yet, is actively pushing them away every single day.   All in all, I’m predicting that Best Buy will not make it to 2030. I hope I’m wrong because workers at Best Buy need jobs. But unfortunately, I see Best Buy following the footsteps of KMart straight to bankruptcy. The board needs to get Cori as far away as possible from Best Buy.   Best of luck,  Former Product Flow Specialist\n",
