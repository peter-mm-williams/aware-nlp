      "Retaliation Prevention Policy: A Former Employee Story; I began my employment at one of Orlando’s Best Buy stores in 2018. Following a year after, I was sexually harassed by my supervisor in late 2019. After reporting that incident, my employment at Best Buy took the worst of turns.  While the store as a whole could agree that my supervisor’s overall behavior at work was questionable (just before being promoted as my supervisor, he had been documented for threatening to physically harm a customer.), his sales for the store were competitively high.  My former supervisor had the highest amount of Total Tech Support sales out of all the employees in the store, while his moods were not always pleasant, he was a crucial part of the team since he helped carry the store’s revenue.  During his short time as my supervisor, he crossed several boundaries which led to his termination. I do want to mention that during the process, the human resources representative assigned to my case during the investigation asked me a question which to this day, I cannot agree with.  *“Why didn’t you say something sooner?”*  This question does not feel sincere, but rather similar to an accusation. Talking about sexual harassment, sexual assault, rape, or any misconduct of that matter, is not an easy subject to open up about. Asking why a victim didn’t rush to speak out feels like a shift of blame. I hope in the future, companies begin to ask more appropriate questions that are more productive to their investigation.  My personal take: Never question the victim’s motives. If you are curious, here’s the answer- we are attempting to cope with whatever trauma we were forced to face.  After the termination of my supervisor, different managers began to share with me that the General Manager of the store was no longer fond of me. I was aware that his behavior towards me had changed. I think about the sexual harassment investigation, remembering my GM’s reaction when he sat next to me during a conference call with human resources.  I told the representative that I had shared with my coworkers the sexual harassment incidents that I had faced. I explained to the representative that I did not feel comfortable with the management at my store, which is why I never came to them. There had been a previous conflict that had occurred in my department which management had not handled professionally.  When I shared this information with the representative, I watched my GM bury his face into the palms of his hands. My intention was never to embarrass the GM or the training of his staff, but to express to human resources why I didn’t feel comfortable confiding in management.  A few days after the termination of my supervisor, I had shared with my GM and the human resources team that I had a concern about an employee who is a family member of my former supervisor. He was a seasonal employee and was had a close relationship with my former supervisor, as they lived together and shared a car. During a casual conversation that I once had with him, he has shared with me that he had been in and out of jail for improper conduct regarding violent behavior.  I shared that conversation with my GM and expressed to him my fear of physical harm or retaliation from this employee. My GM responded to me, “he is seasonal, which means we don’t have to move forward with him. If I were you, I wouldn’t worry about it.”  This had given me peace of mind, until weeks later when I discovered that my GM kept him in the store with a promotion as a full-time employee.  I had felt so deceived by my own General Manager and I no longer felt safe working at the store.  Thinking about the days that followed, my dynamic with my GM changed. He began ignoring me at work. It was very uncomfortable to go into work, walking past each other while making eye-contact, and there being no acknowledgment from him. During some instances, I would be the bigger person and say hello or good morning, but when I did, I was blatantly ignored.  I changed my mindset and accepted that I would come into work to help clients and to stay out of my GM’s way. There did come a point where I was overwhelmed by how often management was warning me about his growing dislike towards me.  In addition, some of the management would tell me that my GM would persistently ask about my performance. They were told that if I was caught doing something that came remotely close to violating policy, to report the incident to my GM immediately. While this is a fair request, asking management to overlook their staff, why was I being targeted specifically? This had made me feel as if my General Manager wanted to ensure that I was under scrutiny.  I’ve always been the person to hear bad news and to stay in a state of shock. I never questioned the management who’d warned me about my GM. I always nodded my head and absorbed the information, never wanting to continue a conversation about how I was potentially in a hostile work environment. To talk about it, was to acknowledge that it existed.  One day, I developed the courage to ask a manager . . .  Me: “Hey, do you know why it is that \\[my GM\\] doesn’t like me?”  Manager: “Did you ever see \\[your former supervisor\\]’s numbers?”  Me: “I guess, but he wasn’t a good employee, I thought?”  Manager: “Right, but you reported a problem that brought HR to fly in from out of state. That doesn’t make \\[your GM\\] look good in front of HR.”  After that answer, I knew at that moment that this was never going to end; my General Manager would see it through to have me terminated.  I received a disciplinary action form some weeks after my supervisor’s termination: a final warning. An employee had come to the store on their day off wanting to exchange a product that had been at an ex-boyfriends house, she had finally been able to retrieve it and wanted to upgrade it to something of a higher quality. I considered that Best Buy’s management always made exceptions outside of the return/exchange policy for customer satisfaction (this exception is a case-by-case decision).  Considering how I was told to look at out-of-policy transactions (to make exceptions for customers who are willing to spend more money during the exchange process.), I asked a nearby manager if my coworker could exchange an item that was out of policy. After the manager had approved the transaction, I was pulled into the GM’s office days later signing my first, final warning.  I had pondered for days wondering if having a manager’s approval still deemed the situation to be a violation of policy. My days of wondering ended soon after I was told that the write up was given solely to ensure that it was on my Best Buy employee record.  One of the managers shared with employees that the GM, being general manager, had the authority to choose the severity of the write-up. Managers shared with employees that my General Manager wanted to ensure that I was put on a final warning.  I had a coworker call me after my shift that day, explaining that they felt that my write up was a form of retaliation. This was an employee who I had not shared any information about my investigation case or how I had been feeling ignored by my GM. However, before ending the call, the employee vowed to report their observations to Best Buy’s human resources.  I approached my GM the following week asking him to look into transferring me to another Best Buy location, but he never followed up with me as promised.  Months later, I called human resources to finally open up about my fear of retaliation from my General Manager. Human resources took note of my statement and opened a case, but they never reached out to me again after that phone call.  It would be wishful thinking to believe that this is all he-said, she-said, work nonsense. However, after having six different managers in the store confirm that my General Manager had it out for me, wishful thinking would be ignorance.  I am currently a former Best Buy employee. I do wonder at times, maybe if I had stopped my coworkers from making that call to Best Buy’s human resources department about my sexual harassment concern with my supervisor, I might still work for Best Buy. Perhaps I would’ve had the opportunity to leave on a good note, with the option of having my general manager as a reference for any future work opportunities. But I’ve come to accept that this isn’t my reality. Best Buy is now a closed chapter of my life.  My purpose for this lengthy reflection is for people to know the truth. The journey to creating a positive work environment for victims who have reported sexual harassment has a long way to go. In a place where I once called my second home, it became the place where I was scared to go to work and where I didn’t feel the support and acceptance from my management team.  I do not discourage women or men that want to report harassment in the workplace, once it’s seen through, it can be a sense of relief. However, I strongly urge people to know that in reporting these concerns, there are consequences that we must face. It is a challenging part of being a victim.  I wish that no one ever has to face half of the battles that I have had to when it’s come to sexual harassment in the workplace, but if you are faced with it, I hope that you choose wisely and do what is ultimately best for you.\n"

      "Part 1: Retaliation Prevention Policy: A Former Employee Story; I began my employment at one of Orlando’s Best Buy stores in 2018. Following a year after, I was sexually harassed by my supervisor in late 2019. After reporting that incident, my employment at Best Buy took the worst of turns.  While the store as a whole could agree that my supervisor’s overall behavior at work was questionable (just before being promoted as my supervisor, he had been documented for threatening to physically harm a customer.), his sales for the store were competitively high.  My former supervisor had the highest amount of Total Tech Support sales out of all the employees in the store, while his moods were not always pleasant, he was a crucial part of the team since he helped carry the store’s revenue.  During his short time as my supervisor, he crossed several boundaries which led to his termination. I do want to mention that during the process, the human resources representative assigned to my case during the investigation asked me a question which to this day, I cannot agree with.  *“Why didn’t you say something sooner?”*  This question does not feel sincere, but rather similar to an accusation. Talking about sexual harassment, sexual assault, rape, or any misconduct of that matter, is not an easy subject to open up about. Asking why a victim didn’t rush to speak out feels like a shift of blame. I hope in the future, companies begin to ask more appropriate questions that are more productive to their investigation.  My personal take: Never question the victim’s motives. If you are curious, here’s the answer- we are attempting to cope with whatever trauma we were forced to face.  After the termination of my supervisor, different managers began to share with me that the General Manager of the store was no longer fond of me. I was aware that his behavior towards me had changed. I think about the sexual harassment investigation, remembering my GM’s reaction when he sat next to me during a conference call with human resources.  I told the representative that I had shared with my coworkers the sexual harassment incidents that I had faced. I explained to the representative that I did not feel comfortable with the management at my store, which is why I never came to them. There had been a previous conflict that had occurred in my department which management had not handled professionally.  When I shared this information with the representative, I watched my GM bury his face into the palms of his hands. My intention was never to embarrass the GM or the training of\n",
      "Part 2: palms of his hands. My intention was never to embarrass the GM or the training of his staff, but to express to human resources why I didn’t feel comfortable confiding in management.  A few days after the termination of my supervisor, I had shared with my GM and the human resources team that I had a concern about an employee who is a family member of my former supervisor. He was a seasonal employee and was had a close relationship with my former supervisor, as they lived together and shared a car. During a casual conversation that I once had with him, he has shared with me that he had been in and out of jail for improper conduct regarding violent behavior.  I shared that conversation with my GM and expressed to him my fear of physical harm or retaliation from this employee. My GM responded to me, “he is seasonal, which means we don’t have to move forward with him. If I were you, I wouldn’t worry about it.”  This had given me peace of mind, until weeks later when I discovered that my GM kept him in the store with a promotion as a full-time employee.  I had felt so deceived by my own General Manager and I no longer felt safe working at the store.  Thinking about the days that followed, my dynamic with my GM changed. He began ignoring me at work. It was very uncomfortable to go into work, walking past each other while making eye-contact, and there being no acknowledgment from him. During some instances, I would be the bigger person and say hello or good morning, but when I did, I was blatantly ignored.  I changed my mindset and accepted that I would come into work to help clients and to stay out of my GM’s way. There did come a point where I was overwhelmed by how often management was warning me about his growing dislike towards me.  In addition, some of the management would tell me that my GM would persistently ask about my performance. They were told that if I was caught doing something that came remotely close to violating policy, to report the incident to my GM immediately. While this is a fair request, asking management to overlook their staff, why was I being targeted specifically? This had made me feel as if my General Manager wanted to ensure that I was under scrutiny.  I’ve always been the person to hear bad news and to stay in a state of shock. I never questioned the management who’d warned me about my GM. I always nodded my head\n",
      "Part 3: I never questioned the management who’d warned me about my GM. I always nodded my head and absorbed the information, never wanting to continue a conversation about how I was potentially in a hostile work environment. To talk about it, was to acknowledge that it existed.  One day, I developed the courage to ask a manager . . .  Me: “Hey, do you know why it is that \\[my GM\\] doesn’t like me?”  Manager: “Did you ever see \\[your former supervisor\\]’s numbers?”  Me: “I guess, but he wasn’t a good employee, I thought?”  Manager: “Right, but you reported a problem that brought HR to fly in from out of state. That doesn’t make \\[your GM\\] look good in front of HR.”  After that answer, I knew at that moment that this was never going to end; my General Manager would see it through to have me terminated.  I received a disciplinary action form some weeks after my supervisor’s termination: a final warning. An employee had come to the store on their day off wanting to exchange a product that had been at an ex-boyfriends house, she had finally been able to retrieve it and wanted to upgrade it to something of a higher quality. I considered that Best Buy’s management always made exceptions outside of the return/exchange policy for customer satisfaction (this exception is a case-by-case decision).  Considering how I was told to look at out-of-policy transactions (to make exceptions for customers who are willing to spend more money during the exchange process.), I asked a nearby manager if my coworker could exchange an item that was out of policy. After the manager had approved the transaction, I was pulled into the GM’s office days later signing my first, final warning.  I had pondered for days wondering if having a manager’s approval still deemed the situation to be a violation of policy. My days of wondering ended soon after I was told that the write up was given solely to ensure that it was on my Best Buy employee record.  One of the managers shared with employees that the GM, being general manager, had the authority to choose the severity of the write-up. Managers shared with employees that my General Manager wanted to ensure that I was put on a final warning.  I had a coworker call me after my shift that day, explaining that they felt that my write up was a form of retaliation. This was an employee\n",
      "Part 4: day, explaining that they felt that my write up was a form of retaliation. This was an employee who I had not shared any information about my investigation case or how I had been feeling ignored by my GM. However, before ending the call, the employee vowed to report their observations to Best Buy’s human resources.  I approached my GM the following week asking him to look into transferring me to another Best Buy location, but he never followed up with me as promised.  Months later, I called human resources to finally open up about my fear of retaliation from my General Manager. Human resources took note of my statement and opened a case, but they never reached out to me again after that phone call.  It would be wishful thinking to believe that this is all he-said, she-said, work nonsense. However, after having six different managers in the store confirm that my General Manager had it out for me, wishful thinking would be ignorance.  I am currently a former Best Buy employee. I do wonder at times, maybe if I had stopped my coworkers from making that call to Best Buy’s human resources department about my sexual harassment concern with my supervisor, I might still work for Best Buy. Perhaps I would’ve had the opportunity to leave on a good note, with the option of having my general manager as a reference for any future work opportunities. But I’ve come to accept that this isn’t my reality. Best Buy is now a closed chapter of my life.  My purpose for this lengthy reflection is for people to know the truth. The journey to creating a positive work environment for victims who have reported sexual harassment has a long way to go. In a place where I once called my second home, it became the place where I was scared to go to work and where I didn’t feel the support and acceptance from my management team.  I do not discourage women or men that want to report harassment in the workplace, once it’s seen through, it can be a sense of relief. However, I strongly urge people to know that in reporting these concerns, there are consequences that we must face. It is a challenging part of being a victim.  I wish that no one ever has to face half of the battles that I have had to when it’s come to sexual harassment in the workplace, but if you are faced with it, I hope that you choose wisely and do what is ultimately best for you.\n"

Following a year after, I was sexually harassed by my supervisor in late 2019. After reporting that incident, my employment at Best Buy took the worst of turns.  While the store as a whole could agree that my supervisor’s overall behavior at work was questionable (just before being promoted as my supervisor, he had been documented for threatening to physically harm a customer.), his sales for the store were competitively high.  My former supervisor had the highest amount of Total Tech Support sales out of all the employees in the store, while his moods were not always pleasant, he was a crucial part of the team since he helped carry the store’s revenue.  During his short time as my supervisor, he crossed several boundaries which led to his termination. I do want to mention that during the process, the human resources representative assigned to my case during the investigation asked me a question which to this day, I cannot agree with.  *“Why didn’t you say something sooner?”*  This question does not feel sincere, but rather similar to an accusation. Talking about sexual harassment, sexual assault, rape, or any misconduct of that matter, is not an easy subject to open up about. Asking why a victim didn’t rush to speak out feels like a shift of blame. I hope in the future, companies begin to ask more appropriate questions that are more productive to their investigation.  My personal take: Never question the victim’s motives. If you are curious, here’s the answer- we are attempting to cope with whatever trauma we were forced to face.  After the termination of my supervisor, different managers began to share with me that the General Manager of the store was no longer fond of me. I was aware that his behavior towards me had changed. I think about the sexual harassment investigation, remembering my GM’s reaction when he sat next to me during a conference call with human resources.  I told the representative that I had shared with my coworkers the sexual harassment incidents that I had faced. I explained to the representative that I did not feel comfortable with the management at my store, which is why I never came to them. There had been a previous conflict that had occurred in my department which management had not handled professionally.  When I shared this information with the representative, I watched my GM bury his face into the palms of his hands. My intention was never to embarrass the GM or the training of his staff, but to express to human resources why I didn’t feel comfortable confiding in management.  A few days after the termination of my supervisor, I had shared with my GM and the human resources team that I had a concern about an employee who is a family member of my former supervisor. He was a seasonal employee and was had a close relationship with my former supervisor, as they lived together and shared a car. During a casual conversation that I once had with him, he has shared with me that he had been in and out of jail for improper conduct regarding violent behavior.  I shared that conversation with my GM and expressed to him my fear of physical harm or retaliation from this employee. My GM responded to me, “he is seasonal, which means we don’t have to move forward with him. If I were you, I wouldn’t worry about it.”  This had given me peace of mind, until weeks later when I discovered that my GM kept him in the store with a promotion as a full-time employee.  I had felt so deceived by my own General Manager and I no longer felt safe working at the store.  Thinking about the days that followed, my dynamic with my GM changed. He began ignoring me at work. It was very uncomfortable to go into work, walking past each other while making eye-contact, and there being no acknowledgment from him. During some instances, I would be the bigger person and say hello or good morning, but when I did, I was blatantly ignored.  I changed my mindset and accepted that I would come into work to help clients and to stay out of my GM’s way. There did come a point where I was overwhelmed by how often management was warning me about his growing dislike towards me.  In addition, some of the management would tell me that my GM would persistently ask about my performance. They were told that if I was caught doing something that came remotely close to violating policy, to report the incident to my GM immediately. While this is a fair request, asking management to overlook their staff, why was I being targeted specifically? This had made me feel as if my General Manager wanted to ensure that I was under scrutiny.  I’ve always been the person to hear bad news and to stay in a state of shock. I never questioned the management who’d warned me about my GM. I always nodded my head and absorbed the information, never wanting to continue a conversation about how I was potentially in a hostile work environment. To talk about it, was to acknowledge that it existed.  One day, I developed the courage to ask a manager . . .  Me: “Hey, do you know why it is that \\\\[my GM\\\\] doesn’t like me?”  Manager: “Did you ever see \\\\[your former supervisor\\\\]’s numbers?”  Me: “I guess, but he wasn’t a good employee, I thought?”  Manager: “Right, but you reported a problem that brought HR to fly in from out of state. That doesn’t make \\\\[your GM\\\\] look good in front of HR.”  After that answer, I knew at that moment that this was never going to end; my General Manager would see it through to have me terminated.  I received a disciplinary action form some weeks after my supervisor’s termination: a final warning. An employee had come to the store on their day off wanting to exchange a product that had been at an ex-boyfriends house, she had finally been able to retrieve it and wanted to upgrade it to something of a higher quality. I considered that Best Buy’s management always made exceptions outside of the return/exchange policy for customer satisfaction (this exception is a case-by-case decision).  Considering how I was told to look at out-of-policy transactions (to make exceptions for customers who are willing to spend more money during the exchange process.), I asked a nearby manager if my coworker could exchange an item that was out of policy. After the manager had approved the transaction, I was pulled into the GM’s office days later signing my first, final warning.  I had pondered for days wondering if having a manager’s approval still deemed the situation to be a violation of policy. My days of wondering ended soon after I was told that the write up was given solely to ensure that it was on my Best Buy employee record.  One of the managers shared with employees that the GM, being general manager, had the authority to choose the severity of the write-up. Managers shared with employees that my General Manager wanted to ensure that I was put on a final warning.  I had a coworker call me after my shift that day, explaining that they felt that my write up was a form of retaliation. This was an employee who I had not shared any information about my investigation case or how I had been feeling ignored by my GM. However, before ending the call, the employee vowed to report their observations to Best Buy’s human resources.  I approached my GM the following week asking him to look into transferring me to another Best Buy location, but he never followed up with me as promised.  Months later, I called human resources to finally open up about my fear of retaliation from my General Manager. Human resources took note of my statement and opened a case, but they never reached out to me again after that phone call.  It would be wishful thinking to believe that this is all he-said, she-said, work nonsense. However, after having six different managers in the store confirm that my General Manager had it out for me, wishful thinking would be ignorance.  I am currently a former Best Buy employee. I do wonder at times, maybe if I had stopped my coworkers from making that call to Best Buy’s human resources department about my sexual harassment concern with my supervisor, I might still work for Best Buy. Perhaps I would’ve had the opportunity to leave on a good note, with the option of having my general manager as a reference for any future work opportunities. But I’ve come to accept that this isn’t my reality. Best Buy is now a closed chapter of my life.  My purpose for this lengthy reflection is for people to know the truth. The journey to creating a positive work environment for victims who have reported sexual harassment has a long way to go. In a place where I once called my second home, it became the place where I was scared to go to work and where I didn’t feel the support and acceptance from my management team.  I do not discourage women or men that want to report harassment in the workplace, once it’s seen through, it can be a sense of relief. However, I strongly urge people to know that in reporting these concerns, there are consequences that we must face. It is a challenging part of being a victim.  I wish that no one ever has to face half of the battles that I have had to when it’s come to sexual harassment in the workplace, but if you are faced with it, I hope that you choose wisely and do what is ultimately best for you.'"

      "0.802: What is your opinion on Best Buy currently.\n",
      "0.759: Why are you at Best Buy?\n",
      "0.750: Don’t listen to this guy, I work there and the team environment is outstanding everyone stands around talking to each other and let’s the antisocial people ring up the customers. You’ll enjoy Best Buy as long as you aren’t antisocial and you actually enjoy technology\n",
      "0.738: Life as a Best Buy worker 💀\n",
      "0.732: Being a veteran and Best Buy employee, I can see what you and OP mean. It really depends on the individual, but the blanket statement is accurate enough.\n",
      "0.721: Best Buy used to be a great company to work for before Corie the CEO took over. Employees used to love working there, staffing was great, it wasn’t all about stupid sales metrics. Times have changed\n",
      "0.719: And one last thing: have an open mind. Best Buy will not be a career for 98% of current employees. Use what skills and knowledge you learn here to springboard yourself into a better, higher paying position. Don’t let complacency and comfortability overtake your potential.\n",
      "0.717: Gotcha, thanks. I only worked at Best Buy for a few months last year, but I'm fascinated by what's going on with this company and its apparent impending doom. So I like to keep up on the drama 😂\n",
      "0.714: Ngl best buy always had an air of suck but man was employee sentiment so much better under Hubert.\n",
      "0.711: I was there almost 5 years before my position was gone. They had no trouble eliminating the position of someone else that was there for almost 30 years. Best Buy does not care about you.\n",
      "0.711: Considering a job at Best Buy; Exactly what the title says. Be brutally honest please. Ups , downs, pay, benefits, health insurance. (I have a few health issues so I need some pretty decent one) What working there is like in a whole. Is it worth it?\n",
      "0.693: Best Buy is a stepping stone for most people. When you factor in all the BS we’ve had to deal with the last couple years, there’s no incentive to stay. The company has made it crystal clear that hard work and loyalty are not enough. We’re all replaceable.\n",
      "0.687: I personally like the benefits of the job especially how they handled the pandemic. As far as the working environment it’s going to very from store to store and I think depends on the management for each store and for me usually the biggest frustration I have are with the customers. If you are really worried about it maybe you could go to the store and walk around and just kind of see how the employees interact with each other. I’ve worked for Walmart and Target previously and I’ve stayed at Best Buy  A LOT longer than I was at any other retail store. As far as the pay I don’t handle that so I’m not to familiar with it.\n",
      "0.685: Are there things you think Best Buy could do to help retain employees that it is not currently doing? i.e. wages, benefits, healthcare, vacation time, etc.?\n",
      "0.682: Move on and look for something better. Or hang in there till you actually find something. Yes, the pay is decent but you can do better based on your experience. Plus best buy looks good as a stepping stone for your resume. Don't think it gets better because it won't. Maybe 6 years ago it was better, but the new version and direction isn't worth the stress. Look around you, if the seasoned staff and veterans are leaving it should be a clear indicator that it's a lost cause. Don't let best buy burn you out or change you as a person for the sake of sales goals.  Best Buy has 0 concern about employee retention. Just credit card apps,TTS and NPS. All factors that affect achievers and leadership bonuses. Not the individuals doing the work. You do everything and get nothing while the leaders get everything.  Get out when you can.\n",
      "0.681: This is for Best Buy employees. Wrong Reddit\n",
      "0.676: It honestly feels like Best Buy wants this type now.  Company used to be about taking care of the customers and its employees.  Now it's all about tricking them.  I don't like this place anymore.\n",
      "0.675: How did you get a job at Best Buy? Did you apply online or walk in and ask to speak with a manager? What did you say to the manager?; ?\n",
      "0.671: This is my honest opinion I just recently left Best Buy after almost a year as part time computer sales. It has its ups and downs.  I found most of my coworkers to be incredible and people I still talk to now after leaving. The work can be easy on slow days as you’re just Downstocking and facing things.  But the worst part is management and metrics. Although your store may be different, this is just my experience, At my store, some associates are getting paid less then minimum wage. You get no incentive for pushing sales. You’re basically a scummy sales man. You push and push and if it doesn’t work you get reprimanded by management. Even having your hours cut down to 4 hours a week if you don’t meet your goals.  You don’t get recognized for your efforts but i understand that’s a lot of workplaces now. A lot of management were misogynistic and did not want to hire women. I could go on and on You honestly might get a pay cut going from Walmart to Best Buy and they very rarely give raises\n",
      "0.670: My friend is a GM of a Costco and has been working with the company for almost 20 years. Sounds like you guys really compensate your employees with MUCH less stress than what BBY puts on their associates.  When I started with Best Buy back in 2006, I wouldn’t have even considered going anywhere else. Yea, we still had ridiculous sales strats like Care+, but the environment was inviting and the department you were in was your family.  Not anymore. The company is drastically headed downhill. I became one of the OG IHAs and did that until 2019 then got out. So glad I did.\n"
