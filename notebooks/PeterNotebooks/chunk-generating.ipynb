I worked there in 2016-17 started in PT sales and worked my way up to FT sales lead until my role was discontinued 1 week into the position. The benefits are just okay and discount pretty generous. However, they focus very hard on unrealistic sales goals, management can be very pushy, and they restructure/eliminate positions/headcount ALL THE TIME.  &#x200B;  More recently, I returned to BBY part time in warehouse (1 day a week, just barely working enough for the discount), but later left just before the holiday season because I did not want to work anymore hours and they were really pressuring me to work. It was a bit more relaxed for me the second time around, mainly because it was 4 hours a week and I did not really care. Warehouse is still very metric/numbers driven, but it's different because you don't have to deal with customers as much, and most of the goals are pretty obtainable depending on how organized your warehouse team is. Although, it's almost impossible to move up in warehouse as your strengths don't show as much as they would in sales/customer service.  &#x200B;  That being said, it can be very easy to move up if you have a positive attitude, play the game of being peppy in their cringe company culture, and obtain/exceed your sales goals. With the turnover, you could land yourself a supervisor position in just a few years. Just don't be discouraged when they restructure and eliminate it, I can guarantee you at some point it will happen.  If you've worked for Walmart, I'm sure BBY is the better option, just learn to play their game. I could be wrong, but I would peg BBY to be in a similar line as Target & Starbucks in regards to quality of the company, but this is just observations and I could be wrong.  &#x200B;  I've also heard Costco has decent benefits, but can't speak to the internal workings of the company and culture.

If you are bored enough to read my stupid life story:  I was part of the grand opening team for a Best Buy in 2006.  35,000 ft.² I was full-time media, basically a senior, but without the actual position or pay.  We had six managers, 12 supervisors, many seniors, and full timers.  I went through the reorg in 2009 and barely kept my position. Supervisors drop to five, managers drop to four.  My stress gave me ulcers.  Our goals got to unrealistic math levels.  In gaming we had to have 8% service plans, accessories 12.5%, 3% geek squad set up services for consoles ($30 to turn the system on and run updates lol).  I had done the math at the time and management was unpleasant with me when I said this was not possible. Nintendo Wii accessory sales when we had no wii remotes 70 nunchucks.  Assuming we literally sold geek squad, black tie protection on each possible device we would not hit our numbers.  And that’s assuming that customers come in and literally buy everything we tell them to.    Speaking of more unrealistic, I was told on a Monday morning to replace all of the price tag’s in gaming, because the wordage for performance replacement, plan (PRP) was rebranded to geek squad black-tie protection replacement plan (GSBTPRP).  I remember telling them that it wasn’t going to happen today and they got upset. Then I used math to show them that approximately 30 4ft sections of games, each having six shelves, minimum seven tags per row assuming that each game magically had its own spot on the shelf and wasn’t stacked in front of another game.  Telzon taking about 10sec per tag in our shitty faraday cage of a store.  Takes about 10 sec to remove old tag and put on new tag.  35 hours of labor assuming the tag printer doesn’t jam, zero customers need help, etc.  and all of this was less than 24 hours after an adset, so basically we had to redo adset is what corporate wanted.  management hated me.  Then there was the gaming initiative in 2011 where I was so optimistic that things were turning around.    At this point I was trying to raise a family and thought this would actually be my career. But then we didn’t receive enough labor for our team',\n",
       " 'thought this would actually be my career. But then we didn’t receive enough labor for our team full-time or had to work 32 1/2 hours supervisor 37 minimum.  We had two part-timers that got about 12 hours each.  Best Buy was talking about how bad shrink was and gaming, just like it always has been, and just like it always will be, but we did not have the labor to be staffed during each open hour.  Not to mention any labor for truck, adset, etc.  Then my position was removed August 2012.  The writing was on the wall.  I could either take severance or any of the available full-time positions that would exist.  Problem is there are three stores in our area, not counting the Best Buy mobiles.  So it was a dog pile of people for one or two positions that paid less than what we made five years ago at that point.    I took the severance, eight years of professional workmanship gone.  but a lot of my former friends and colleagues were still stuck on the Best Buy train wreck.  I joined this sub Reddit just to see how things have been going but it’s not very optimistic. Most of my bad dreams have been of regular work at Best Buy.  Now, almost everyone I know is out of Best Buy and has long since moved on. Years ago, Best Buy got rid of 401(k), matching I remember reading. Which is the most petty way of saying we don’t care about our employees and we are pretending that this is a cost savings measure.  The few old coworkers that remained said that they are sharing a manager between multiple stores. Almost nobody is full-time. They have like two supervisors. Which means some key holders are literally part time, so have no stake in the company.  All risk no reward.  Pay is capped at comical levels.  I just needed to get all that off my chest.

In store, you could do this by explaining that TT includes discounts and since it covers services and labor on what they are purchasing, a new PC setup & migration in-store or in-home would be cheaper with TT, plus it includes a better warranty on most devices.   “Would you like me to have one of our Geek Squad agents come set up your new computer? They can transfer the data and make sure everything is working. If you have any questions a few weeks after using it, they can come back out. Typically appointments are $130+ per visit, but with TT, it would just be $200 for the entire year.” If they start to roll their eyes, I usually feel weird because sales feels gross, so I say, “I know, I have to mention it because it’s a really good deal,” and then I will just move right along. Maybe mention it again a little later, “so you’re going to set this up and transfer your data yourself, right?” *As I type this, I am realizing I am a manipulative little shit and maybe I do like sales hmm…*  Do you know any of the Geek Squad agents in your precinct?

I finally had to assert myself and clearly confirm that I am quitting. Then I ask to confirm that my last shift will be in the coming week, and my ASM says, \"No, you just gave your two-week notice, so you will have to work two more weeks,\" completely ignoring the fact that I had already given my two-week notice to the GM more than a week previous.

The right to privacy in the US is pretty much this;\"It is not illegal to record someone without their consent in a public place if they are visible and audible, especially if they don’t have reasonable expectations of privacy. But in a private setting, such as a bathroom or changing area, recording someone without their knowledge is illegal.\" **UNLESS** the state has a 2 party consent law.

However, retail locations and most other businesses are not public areas. It is private property that you are allowed to come purchase items from during certain times of the day. Actual public areas fall along the lines of sidewalks, streets, parks, etc. They are usually locations owned by the city/state and paid for by taxpayers (the general public). Business buildings, even their parking lots, are owned by landlords or the business themselves not the general public.  Either way, in almost all circumstances, you should always ask permission to film. It should be common courtesy out of shear decency, especially to people who are just trying to do their job.',\n",

I don\\'t know all the specifics however the main ones that I remember are:  * You have to be making a gift purchase to be given to an individual for individual use, or to a qualified non-profit organization * Cannot purchase items for use in for profit business, or to be intended for resale using employee discount  * Employee cannot be reimbursed by the person/organization you\\'re giving the gift to * Additionally, it is my understanding that employees may purchase GSP/ Protection and services/ installations as qualified gifts as well.  If you purchase through dotcom make sure the shipping/ delivery address is for that person, not your address * I personally recommended that the services/ GSP be setup in the name of the person / organization you\\'re giving the gift to * Also recommend that you put the gift purchase on it\\'s own sale/purchase and don\\'t combine with other personal purchases * Strongly recommend you provide the giftee with a gift receipt, if not a copy of the actual receipt for their records, and in case anything happens where they have to warranty claim on it. *  If you\\'re shipping to a different store for pickup, make sure you list the person picking up the product\\'s actual first and last name as it says on their state issued ID, and tell them to bring state issued ID with them to pickup.  Finally, be aware that employee purchases, including qualified gifts, are tracked and can be scrutinized by internal audit / asset protection teams and discounted goods/ services/ etc. may also count as taxable non-wage income on your W-2. If you have specific questions, don\\'t take my word for it--follow up with a inquiry to HR about the qualified gift policy to make sure you\\'re making the right choices and following the procedures correctly.   TLDR: Yes you can use employee discount for QUALIFIED GIFTS. There is a policy. Follow up with HR for specific details on what you can and can\\'t do.  Good luck!',\n",

She WILL eventually cut EVERY full time worker- management, sales, warehouse, distribution and everything else. The endgame appears to be reduce Best Buy to being an IP that will be sold to Amazon and Amazon will take over the actual operational costs while it gains a  retail showroom. So for any of you who thought that timeline was somewhere far off in the future, take a HARD look at a week ago, the second massive layoff in two years.  She is intentionally crippling the stores so that she can justify closing them when sales inevitably fall after lack of service drives customers completely out of brick and mortar. Her \"facts\" used to justify doing this are a set of self-fulfilling dictums which falsely inflate online sales figures while minimizing brick and mortar contributions, and she\\'s either too greedy or too stupid to see that either she is being fed bad information or more likely, she is the source of that misinformation.  Right now, cutting staff can produce short term gains, but it is at the cost of long-term stability and sustainability and she knows that. When the stock value inevitably starts tanking hard and doesn\\'t stop, the short term losses it causes will be assets, as she and the board can buy back even more shares of the company and when the sale to Amazon goes through, those shares will become worth billions.

Anyway - I’m a customer, my grandparents are old and decided they wanted to buy us new appliances for our first house. We bought 4 LG appliances to get the 10% off instant rebate, but ended up having to do 2 separate transactions online because the fridge would show as out of stock unless it was the only thing being purchased. This messed up the instant 10% rebate.   I talked to a lot of people at customer service (online and on the phone) about it and finally someone understood. He talked to his supervisor and was able to get approval to issue me $900 in gift cards instead of a refund. Okay, cool, no biggie. He said it would be split into 2 because of the high dollar amount.  Again, cool.  After 2 hours on the phone, he assured me we were good to go and gave me a reference number “just in case.”   I called in today to ask if they could give me the gift card number over the phone so I could make on online purchase before the physical cards arrive. After being transferred 4 times, I finally am talking to someone who says he can help. The previous people had mentioned they saw the cards were issued, but couldn’t see the codes due to the high dollar amount. The rep I’m talking to eventually tells me that that those gift cards weren’t actually issued and I wouldn’t be getting them. He said it was because one gift card had already been issued to me and they can only do one gift card per order. The gift card I had received was for like $150 because I had a hell of a time getting the contractors to come out and install the waterline for my fridge. The conversation ended with me talking to his supervisor who told me he could offer a gift card for $200 but that was it. He said he was the highest level of supervisor to talk to, he agreed I was entitled to the full $900 but said he could only do $200 and that I shouldn’t have trusted the previous reps that I had talked to??

What this leads to is most mobile associates not being able to take our California government required 10min rest breaks.   I’m not sure about other states, but in California we are apparently supposed to get paid an extra hour of labor at our regular rate for each break we are not given and even though nobody at Best Buy explicitly says “no you can’t take a break”, it is  heavily implied that we shouldn’t (especially when we are super busy).   Best Buy reports record profits but keeps cutting labor which puts the pressure even more on us because we have to keep picking up the slack for missing coworkers, which is also leading to an ever decreasing moral and mental health of employees, leading to more call outs and even more missing labor.   Best Buy corporate needs to either start hiring more people or implement break tracking with TLC to make sure employees are getting properly compensated for missing breaks. While employees own a certain amount of responsibility to make sure they take their breaks, the company owns even more of that responsibility as they don’t schedule enough people in specialized departments like mobile, who can cover for breaks.   So assuming you’ve been working full time for Best Buy for a few years and how many breaks you have been forced to skip due to low coverage. 40 breaks? 100 breaks? So many you don’t even know what a break is anymore?  If the company minimum wage is $15/hr, how much money has Best Buy stolen from you?

A customer wanted me to price match the one from Walmart. The one we sold was 109.99 while the one on Walmarts website was 99.00. I double checked by typing in the model number into Google to see if it would bring it up, and it did. I thought I read the numbers right and went ahead and price matched it.   The make, the color, that was the same.   Just found out the model number was NOT the same as I initially thought.   The model I sold her was 2149282.   The model I price matched was 2142925.   It was a major oversight on my part because I thought they were the same when I also looked it up in Walmarts online app. And I did it again but now it's saying it can't be found! I heard a horror story how Best BUY priced matched some premium appliances and as a result the company couldn't sell the appliances for years!   And a manager did approve of this he took me for my word! And now I feel like shit! Is he going to get in trouble because of me?! What should I do? I really don't wanna be the reason we can't sell Mr. Coffee stuff anymore! And I really don't want that manager to lose his job because of my dumbass mistake! If I lose my job I deserve it but I don't wanna be responsible for someone else losing their job over my dumb mistake!   I'm wanting to inform the managers tomorrow but what else should I do? Is there anything I can do? I'm so sorry.\",\n",

       "      <td>Restructuring to Micromarket; The micromarket Company restructure was piloted for about 2 years in NY and essentially became the company  gold standard... The idea is simply put as so - the micromarket would work like one big store (how SWAS was before) however resources are deployable from the Hub store (hence why Hub stores have the most headcount and generally the best of the best)... If a micromarket has 3 stores, picture those 3 stores as 1 big store - that's the idea behind the cuts and deployable labor from the hub store - in so many words, it's like a \"loyalty 1\" but to another store vs another department... From this perspective, you don't need 3 GSMs but 1 Services experience manager (the best GSM supposedly) to run this \"big store\" or MM and the other 2 GSMs would get cut... Evaluations were made based on personal ranking submitted to GM, GM rankings of leaders submitted to MM director (also the hub store GM but not really - they are like a DM of their MM but do have the Hub store as their home location) and then \"in partnership\" with AVP (Marketplace manager, more to come) and HR and 3rd party company (DEI/ESG) - decisions were made on who would stay and who would leave... How those decisions were made were never explained to the individuals getting severance so that was essentially a mystery except to the parties involved in the decision making... Many stores were left in complete shock at who was retained and how the leaders were let go (basically, the leaders were scheduled to work and during their shift, they were given the scripted speech with their severance information, hopes of roles popping open soon in JOS, and being walk out the building without telling anyone what just happened and not being able to say bye to their teams). The main concern with the scheduled sit down severance speeches were to ensure that \"GMs got the store keys back to prevent having to rekey the buildings\" - as far as how the leader felt or having an opportunity to speak to anyone, that was placed at 0% priority or concern.  The Micromarket restructuring started about a year ago and I may have missed a few areas however, in general, this is pretty accurate.   Corporate: many mergers and cuts occurred there as well, I don't have too many details as that was outside of my wheelhouse however, it was very impactful</td>\n",

       "      <td>have too many details as that was outside of my wheelhouse however, it was very impactful when I was informed.  Territory, Market, District: essentially all of those leaders and their staff were absorbed into a \"Marketplace\". A marketplace is like 3-4 districts from a legacy perspective (which was like 2 markets to go a little further) and managed by an AVP (assistant Vice President)... So obviously, there were a lot of cuts from the territory, market and district levels (many of those leaders saw the writing on the wall and left beforehand)... Many went the corporate route or multichannel/unit route or home services route (as remote work was and still is overemphasized and overresourced however, still pretty safe in comparison to employees inside 4 walls) and then the rest were simply laid off... Many hundreds of years of tenure gone down the drain.  Field Agents: Essentially cut in half, this happened like a week ago around independence day.  Precinct: GSMs cut (there is one Services Experience manager per micromarket now in store and some stores have a services supervisor but not all).   Sales: all ASMs cut in half (with the exception of one Hub store per micromarket which may have 2-3 ASM - experience managers as they are called now, will be responsible and accountable for both Sales and Ops and will have a few weeks to learn the ropes). All SSMs cut whether appliances, connected, mobile, etc - they generally got absorbed into the Sup staffing headcount... Sups cut down to 2 or 3 maximum per store with 1 possibly being services supervisor for GSP (again, not every store had this Staffing Headcount - some stores got rid of GSM and the Senior is running the show in partnership with MM services experience manager). From sales, it's safe to say that at least 50% of the leaders were laid off (if you go from the furlough days of pandemic - you can say that 50% advisors have been cut since then as well although, this was not part of the micromarket op model) and what was replaced was a bucket of 40 hours per week per store of labor in leadership bucket for shift leads... If a store has 6 shift leads for example, each will get \"up to\" 7 hours of Shift lead pay per week - some more than others depending on how many managerial tasks/duties they are assigned... Shift leads</td>\n",

Shift leads are essentially supposed to be your \"cream of the crop\" talent (although many stores were amateurishly handing out the position like candy on Halloween - how we used to do with backup VPLs in the past - and now are battling an uphill battle with the selections they made)... The way it should work is that SL get scheduled that labor \"activity\" (as it is not a Job Code per se but more of a skillset you schedule like you would a \"monthly training\" or \"new hire\") after being certified via elearnings and leadership approval in Learning Network... Those SLs should have been the best hourly line level employees and essentially were runner-up for Sup roles or what have you... The problem that is occurring in store now is that, there is a nudge coming from leadership that basically states the following \"a SL performs managerial duties when scheduled; a good SL performs managerial duties when needed; a great SL performs managerial duties at all times\" - the conflict arises when these SLs forget that they still have to contribute to store Performance and Look and Feel causing a \"power trip\" effect and fellow advisors getting upset at their high horse syndrome... Some more intelligent veteran SLs say, \"I will only perform key calls, overrides, MOD resolutions, etc while I'm being paid as SL\" because they are aware that there would be no promotional opportunity any time soon... This will by far be the greatest hurdle for the company as many of these veteran advisors working as SLs are not \"drinking the juice\" and feel that the company cut a plethora of leaders yet the job still remains to complete - end result, the SL must perform and/or verify the task completion for lesser pay than previous Sups and without the name tag title to go along with... Obviously, this causes conflicts among advisors who are not SLs as jealousy or envy or even misunderstanding of the SL role causes internal discomfort and conflicts.  Product flow: essentially now a team which are led by shift leads (on a daily basis however, the EM for each store in partnership with GM and MM director could make a Sup in charge of Ops but not company directive). The traditional daily tasks, Merch, plano, Swat, Truck, etc are all merged into a bucket of labor now - there isn't a direct leader in the warehouse per se</td>\n",

       "      <td>merged into a bucket of labor now - there isn't a direct leader in the warehouse per se simply some SLs unless a MM decides to use a Sup for Ops (highly unlikely yet, some do have a process or Specialty Coach that may be utilized for \"setting direction\" in the MM)... As in the sales floor dilemmas, PF probably has much more as things like Truck night are being led by an able bodied advisor yet, they may back off the actual physical labor and \"manage\" the truck team the whole night... The \"too many chiefs, not enough Indians\" conflict arises (just as it does on the Sales floor) and many of the SLs have slim to no experience in actual people leading to diffuse the conflicts and create reasonable solutions... Again, the greatest issue will be getting the SL program under control as many may confuse the job activity with the job title and feel empowered to believe they are no longer required to roll their sleeves up and work.  Outcome - apparently, NY micromarket stated that it took quite some time to get it figured out but that they love it now... I can say this was said to me by a few GMs when I was doing training with them (they kept winning on many of the scorecards at the time and it sparked my curiosity)... Turnover is expected of course and as cold as that may seem, it's actually calculated and even taken into account with salary compensation for those employees moving forward.  Many are not in favor and feel that these changes and restructurings are occurring so quickly that uncertainty and employee morale are at an all time low... These changes including the changes that occurred with Total Tech (TTS, TT, MBBYTotal, etc) are all signs of amateur leadership from the top or signs of potential financial distress - definitely not well organized or thorough... That would probably be the most accurate assumption today and most employees would leave the company given the opportunity to as they feel the company no longer has its original core values and employee experience at heart... Some feel empowered and some have enthusiasm as they feel that many of the tenured leaders leaving will open up doors for their careers... Who's right? Only time will tell.</td>\n",

Evaluations were made based on personal ranking submitted to GM, GM rankings of leaders submitted to MM director (also the hub store GM but not really - they are like a DM of their MM but do have the Hub store as their home location) and then \"in partnership\" with AVP (Marketplace manager, more to come) and HR and 3rd party company (DEI/ESG) - decisions were made on who would stay and who would leave... How those decisions were made were never explained to the individuals getting severance so that was essentially a mystery except to the parties involved in the decision making... Many stores were left in complete shock at who was retained and how the leaders were let go (basically, the leaders were scheduled to work and during their shift, they were given the scripted speech with their severance information, hopes of roles popping open soon in JOS, and being walk out the building without telling anyone what just happened and not being able to say bye to their teams). The main concern with the scheduled sit down severance speeches were to ensure that \"GMs got the store keys back to prevent having to rekey the buildings\" - as far as how the leader felt or having an opportunity to speak to anyone, that was placed at 0% priority or concern.  The Micromarket restructuring started about a year ago and I may have missed a few areas however, in general, this is pretty accurate.   Corporate: many mergers and cuts occurred there as well, I don't have too many details as that was outside of my wheelhouse however, it was very impactful  \n",
       "2739                                                                                                    have too many details as that was outside of my wheelhouse however, it was very impactful when I was informed.  Territory, Market, District: essentially all of those leaders and their staff were absorbed into a \"Marketplace\". A marketplace is like 3-4 districts from a legacy perspective (which was like 2 markets to go a little further) and managed by an AVP (assistant Vice President)... So obviously, there were a lot of cuts from the territory, market and district levels (many of those leaders saw the writing on the wall and left beforehand)... Many went the corporate route or multichannel/unit route or home services route (as remote work was and still is overemphasized and overresourced however, still pretty safe in comparison to employees inside 4 walls) and then the rest were simply laid off... Many hundreds of years of tenure gone down the drain.  Field Agents: Essentially cut in half, this happened like a week ago around independence day.  Precinct: GSMs cut (there is one Services Experience manager per micromarket now in store and some stores have a services supervisor but not all).   Sales: all ASMs cut in half (with the exception of one Hub store per micromarket which may have 2-3 ASM - experience managers as they are called now, will be responsible and accountable for both Sales and Ops and will have a few weeks to learn the ropes). All SSMs cut whether appliances, connected, mobile, etc - they generally got absorbed into the Sup staffing headcount... Sups cut down to 2 or 3 maximum per store with 1 possibly being services supervisor for GSP (again, not every store had this Staffing Headcount - some stores got rid of GSM and the Senior is running the show in partnership with MM services experience manager). From sales, it's safe to say that at least 50% of the leaders were laid off (if you go from the furlough days of pandemic - you can say that 50% advisors have been cut since then as well although, this was not part of the micromarket op model) and what was replaced was a bucket of 40 hours per week per store of labor in leadership bucket for shift leads... If a store has 6 shift leads for example, each will get \"up to\" 7 hours of Shift lead pay per week - some more than others depending on how many managerial tasks/duties they are assigned... Shift leads  \n",
       "2740  some more than others depending on how many managerial tasks/duties they are assigned... Shift leads are essentially supposed to be your \"cream of the crop\" talent (although many stores were amateurishly handing out the position like candy on Halloween - how we used to do with backup VPLs in the past - and now are battling an uphill battle with the selections they made)... The way it should work is that SL get scheduled that labor \"activity\" (as it is not a Job Code per se but more of a skillset you schedule like you would a \"monthly training\" or \"new hire\") after being certified via elearnings and leadership approval in Learning Network... Those SLs should have been the best hourly line level employees and essentially were runner-up for Sup roles or what have you... The problem that is occurring in store now is that, there is a nudge coming from leadership that basically states the following \"a SL performs managerial duties when scheduled; a good SL performs managerial duties when needed; a great SL performs managerial duties at all times\" - the conflict arises when these SLs forget that they still have to contribute to store Performance and Look and Feel causing a \"power trip\" effect and fellow advisors getting upset at their high horse syndrome... Some more intelligent veteran SLs say, \"I will only perform key calls, overrides, MOD resolutions, etc while I'm being paid as SL\" because they are aware that there would be no promotional opportunity any time soon... This will by far be the greatest hurdle for the company as many of these veteran advisors working as SLs are not \"drinking the juice\" and feel that the company cut a plethora of leaders yet the job still remains to complete - end result, the SL must perform and/or verify the task completion for lesser pay than previous Sups and without the name tag title to go along with... Obviously, this causes conflicts among advisors who are not SLs as jealousy or envy or even misunderstanding of the SL role causes internal discomfort and conflicts.  Product flow: essentially now a team which are led by shift leads (on a daily basis however, the EM for each store in partnership with GM and MM director could make a Sup in charge of Ops but not company directive). The traditional daily tasks, Merch, plano, Swat, Truck, etc are all merged into a bucket of labor now - there isn't a direct leader in the warehouse per se  \n",
       "2741                                                                                                                                                                                                                         merged into a bucket of labor now - there isn't a direct leader in the warehouse per se simply some SLs unless a MM decides to use a Sup for Ops (highly unlikely yet, some do have a process or Specialty Coach that may be utilized for \"setting direction\" in the MM)... As in the sales floor dilemmas, PF probably has much more as things like Truck night are being led by an able bodied advisor yet, they may back off the actual physical labor and \"manage\" the truck team the whole night... The \"too many chiefs, not enough Indians\" conflict arises (just as it does on the Sales floor) and many of the SLs have slim to no experience in actual people leading to diffuse the conflicts and create reasonable solutions... Again, the greatest issue will be getting the SL program under control as many may confuse the job activity with the job title and feel empowered to believe they are no longer required to roll their sleeves up and work.  Outcome - apparently, NY micromarket stated that it took quite some time to get it figured out but that they love it now... I can say this was said to me by a few GMs when I was doing training with them (they kept winning on many of the scorecards at the time and it sparked my curiosity)... Turnover is expected of course and as cold as that may seem, it's actually calculated and even taken into account with salary compensation for those employees moving forward.  Many are not in favor and feel that these changes and restructurings are occurring so quickly that uncertainty and employee morale are at an all time low... These changes including the changes that occurred with Total Tech (TTS, TT, MBBYTotal, etc) are all signs of amateur leadership from the top or signs of potential financial distress - definitely not well organized or thorough... That would probably be the most accurate assumption today and most employees would leave the company given the opportunity to as they feel the company no longer has its original core values and employee experience at heart... Some feel empowered and some have enthusiasm as they feel that many of the tenured leaders leaving will open up doors for their careers... Who's right? Only time will tell.  "
