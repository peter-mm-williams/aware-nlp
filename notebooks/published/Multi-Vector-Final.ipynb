    "summaries = ['The document is a forum post from a person living in California who is considering moving to North Carolina to be closer to their family. They are debating whether to transfer to a Best Buy store in North Carolina or start working at a new company. They like working at Best Buy, but have had negative experiences with some of the stores on the east coast. They also mention the advantage of a higher minimum wage in North Carolina, but the potential disadvantage of lower wages at Best Buy compared to California. The post does not provide a clear answer to their question and is seeking advice from the forum community.',\n",
    " \"The document states that the minimum wage at the company is currently $15 per hour. It is unclear from the information provided whether wage adjustments are made when an employee transfers within the company. However, it is noted that if an employee's current wage is not close to the maximum for their position, they should not expect a significant change in pay upon transfer.\",\n",
    " 'The document suggests that it is generally a good idea to transfer to a new location instead of looking for a job after arriving, as it ensures that you have employment upon arrival. If you are not satisfied with the new job, you can always look for a different one.',\n",
    " \"The document indicates that the author has a friend who is employed at Best Buy in NC, and that the friend's work experience is similar to what Best Buy employees experience in other parts of the US. The document does not provide any additional information or context.\",\n",
    " 'The document consists of a single line of text that poses a question to the reader: \"Next layoffs will hit.\" This is followed by a link to a Reddit poll, which suggests that the text is related to a discussion about potential layoffs. However, the document does not provide any additional context or information on the subject.',\n",
    " \"The document appears to express frustration with a company that is described as greedy. The author is concerned that the corporation will increase its pay, but only for a single employee who will have to work alone all day, leading to increased stress. The main points of the document are criticism of the company's perceived greed and concern over the potential negative impact on the employee's work experience.\",\n",
    " 'The document consists of a single question asking if employees will be receiving their paychecks earlier than usual for Christmas. The author suggests that this might be the case, but also acknowledges that it may not be. The document does not provide an answer to this question.',\n",
    " \"The document states that the speaker's payment was received on the 27th of the previous year, which was a Friday. Given that Christmas falls on a Friday this year, the speaker suggests that payment will be received on that day. It can be summarized as: The speaker expects to receive payment on the Friday that Christmas occurs this year, based on the payment date of the previous year.\",\n",
    " \"The document appears to contain a brief message stating that the store will not be open. The author or authors of the message have indicated that they recently received payment during the previous week. The reason for the store's closure is not mentioned in the message.\",\n",
    " \"The document states that the speaker's group received their salary on the previous Friday. For those working in locations with a different pay schedule, the speaker expects the payment to be received either in advance or on the usual Friday. The payment is made electronically and is typically submitted on Tuesdays.\",\n",
    " 'The document suggests that the person might have injured their back while taking down a heavy item from a high shelf. The following steps are recommended:\\n\\n1. Stop any activity and take a rest.\\n2. Apply ice to the affected area to reduce pain and swelling.\\n3. Consider taking over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen, to help manage the pain.\\n4. If the pain persists or worsens, seek medical attention from a healthcare professional.\\n\\nIt is important to avoid strenuous activity and heavy lifting until the back pain has resolved.',\n",
    " 'The document is instructing the reader to take two actions in the event of an unknown situation: first, to inform a manager, and second, to seek medical attention from a doctor. This could be in response to an accident, injury, or other situation where medical attention may be required. It is important to notify a manager in addition to seeking medical help, possibly to ensure that proper protocols are followed and that the necessary actions are taken on the job or workplace.',\n",
    " \"The document recommends that, if an incident occurs, the manager should complete an incident form and the individual should seek medical attention immediately. It is important to ensure that the doctor conducts thorough testing to determine if the injury is permanent. The document warns that companies may try to avoid responsibility for such incidents, so it is crucial to obtain all communications and information in writing. This advice is based on the author's personal experience of injuring their back while working on the salesfloor.\",\n",
    " \"The individual's manager has requested that they visit a doctor first, independently, to obtain a medical evaluation. Once the doctor's appointment has been completed, the manager will then proceed to fill out the accident form, using the doctor's note as supporting documentation.\",\n",
    " \"The document is a question about how to determine a company's target demographic, with a focus on selling products that meet the needs of specific customers. The example used is headphones, and the question asks how to tailor offerings to different types of customers, such as an audiophile with young children or a sports enthusiast who also enjoys music. The individual is seeking information on how to effectively market and sell products by understanding the specific needs and preferences of their target demographic.\",\n",
    " 'The training for headphones is typically provided by manufacturers, who only compare their products to others within their own lineup. A good way to compare headphones from different brands is to read online reviews from credible sources that offer “best of” articles. For the person described, high-end professional headphones that cost $600-700 with Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) technology, such as the Sony WH-1000XM4 or AirPods Max, would be suitable if they need to tune out distractions from children. ANC may not be a common feature for audiophile purists.',\n",
    " 'The document likely advocates for a united response from workers to layoffs that occurred over a year ago. It suggests that workers should come together and take action in response to the layoffs. The message is one of solidarity and collective action.',\n",
    " 'The document being summarized appears to be a personal opinion or statement expressing the view that the reasons for Best Buy employees to form a union are valid. The phrase \"stuff like this\" likely refers to specific issues or experiences that the speaker has observed or heard about, which they believe demonstrate a need for employees to unionize in order to improve their working conditions or job security. However, the specific details of these issues are not provided in the summary statement.',\n",
    " \"The document expresses dissatisfaction with a company's decision to make extreme cuts, including layoffs, to improve earning reports and please stockholders. The author considers this a sign of a dying business and finds it ironic that the company is giving bonuses after laying off employees who were like family.\",\n",
    " 'The document appears to be a brief message from an individual who has been working at Best Buy for eight years. They express a wish that they had been let go from their job, as they would have taken the severance package offered. This suggests that the individual is dissatisfied with their employment at Best Buy.',\n",
    " 'The document suggests an alternative approach to layoffs or \"cuts\" at a company. Instead of abruptly letting go of employees, the company could offer a transition period during which employees could choose to leave voluntarily or switch to part-time work. This could reduce the amount of backlash and vitriol from affected employees. The document also suggests that some employees may be willing to leave or work part-time if given the opportunity, which could help the company avoid layoffs altogether. The document uses the example of an employee who wanted to be fired, and suggests that offering a voluntary exit could have been a better option for both the employee and the company.',\n",
    " 'The document asserts that companies/factories which previously moved their operations to Mexico are now planning to relocate to another poor country due to increasing labor costs in Mexico. This trend of exploiting cheap labor in developing countries is expected to continue until efforts are made to break the cycle.',\n",
    " \"The document is a complaint about Best Buy's handling of the pre-orders for the new Final Fantasy game. The author notes that customers who pre-ordered should have received a steel book, but many did not. The author, who works at Best Buy, reports that their store received only a small number of steel books despite a larger number of pre-orders. The author criticizes Best Buy's pre-order process and advises against pre-ordering from the retailer. Many customer reviews also indicate that they did not receive their steel books.\",\n",
    " 'The document appears to contain a brief summary of an issue with a manufacturer failing to provide a sufficient quantity of products. The issue is not related to Best Buy.',\n",
    " 'The document appears to be a fragmented message about distributing copies of something on Wednesday, possibly a product or promotional material. There is also a question about checking street dates related to product flow. It seems that there is strong employee support for this distribution effort.',\n",
    " 'The document appears to consist of a single sentence, \"Lmaaaoooo if that ain’t fucking true,\" which does not contain any substantive information or arguments. It is difficult to summarize this sentence further as it does not appear to be making a coherent statement or expressing a complete thought.',\n",
    " 'The document appears to be a single sentence stating \"Excuse me, this seems to have a dent in it.\" This suggests that the speaker or writer has noticed some kind of damage in the form of a dent on an object they are referring to. They are politely bringing it to the attention of the recipient of the message. Without more context, it is difficult to provide a more detailed summary.',\n",
    " \"The document is a Reddit post discussing the author's experience of receiving pre-order bonuses from a store. The author was surprised to find that some stores actually verify and provide pre-order bonuses, unlike their previous experiences. The post also includes a picture of the pre-order bonus items, which are additional game content or merchandise offered by retailers when a customer pre-orders a game. The author's surprise highlights the fact that not all stores consistently provide pre-order bonuses, making it a positive and notable experience for the author.\",\n",
    " 'The document states that customers may receive a free steel book with their purchase, but it is not guaranteed as it depends on availability. If the steel book is not sent with the initial order, it will be shipped separately when it becomes available.',\n",
    " 'The person had pre-ordered something and a week after the initial order, a steel book version of the product was offered. The steel book was received one day later than expected, but the person was still satisfied.',\n",
    " 'The document does not provide a direct answer to the question, but it does mention that Best Buy employees receive a discount on both new and open box products. The exact details of the discount, such as the percentage off or specific eligibility for open box TVs, are not provided. It is best to check with Best Buy directly for the most accurate information.',\n",
    " 'The document states that Geeksquad employees are permitted to label a television as being in \"fair\" condition, making it eligible for an additional discount, if an employee intends to purchase the television for their personal use.',\n",
    " 'The document suggests that in the past year, some employees were terminated for engaging in certain behavior. While the specific behavior is not specified, the author advises caution, recommending that it should not be done often and should be done discreetly to avoid detection.',\n",
    " 'The document states that there are no official discounts offered on open box items. This means that the price of open box items, which are products that have been opened or used but are still in good condition, are not reduced officially. However, individual retailers may choose to offer discounts on open box items at their own discretion.',\n",
    " 'The document warns to use a certain approach, presumably related to purchasing items, sparingly and with a delay between marking down an item and purchasing it, in order to avoid being obvious.',\n",
    " 'The document does not provide specific information about a discount on non open box items. It only mentions that non open box items are used or refurbished products that are in good condition and come with a warranty. It is recommended to contact the seller or check their website for information on any discounts or promotions for non open box items.',\n",
    " 'The individual is inquiring about the Geek Squad protection plan they purchased for their $1,300 computer, which costs $269 for 3 years. They want to know what kind of damage can be covered under the plan and are looking for a way to \"scam\" or exploit the system to receive store credit towards a new computer if they don\\'t use the plan. They claim that store employees suggested this possibility.',\n",
    " \"The document explains the process for obtaining a payout for a faulty computer. Unlike other devices, computers must be sent for repair multiple times (up to three times for the same issue) before a payout can be considered. The computer must be severely damaged and beyond cost-effective repair for a payout to be issued on the first repair attempt. The protection policy only covers normal use, so damage caused by abnormal use (e.g., falling out of a monster truck) is not covered. Additionally, the repair process can take several weeks per repair attempt, depending on the repair shop's workload.\",\n",
    " 'The document indicates that the launch day is scheduled for tomorrow and that it is expected to be an enjoyable event. It also contains a cryptic message, \"If you know, you know,\" which could mean that additional information or context is known or understood by certain individuals. Overall, the document is brief and leaves many details unspecified.',\n",
    " 'The document you provided is a webpage from a recipe blog, featuring a recipe for \"The Best Vegan Mac and Cheese.\" The recipe is a vegan version of the classic comfort food, made with a sauce based on cashews, carrots, and potatoes, along with nutritional yeast, lemon juice, and spices. The recipe also includes instructions for preparing elbow pasta and breadcrumbs for topping. The blogger claims that the recipe is \"so creamy and delicious, even non-vegans will love it!\" The webpage also includes step-by-step photos of the preparation process and tips for customization.',\n",
    " 'The document does not provide sufficient information to summarize. The title \"Launch for what?\" is not descriptive enough to provide context for a summary. In order to summarize a document, it is necessary to have a coherent and informative text that provides details, facts, or arguments about a specific topic. This summary would typically include the main ideas, arguments, or conclusions presented in the document. However, without a clear and informative text, it is not possible to provide a summary.',\n",
    " 'The document consists of a single sentence, \"Bro is loosing it,\" which suggests that someone named Bro is losing control of his emotions or behavior. However, without additional context, it is difficult to provide a more detailed summary.',\n",
    " \"The document you provided is a table showing the specifications of a Samsung Galaxy A51 smartphone. Here is a summary of the key specifications:\\n\\n* The Samsung Galaxy A51 is a touchscreen smartphone with a 6.5-inch Super AMOLED display.\\n* It is powered by an octa-core processor with 4GB or 6GB of RAM and 64GB or 128GB of internal storage, which can be expanded using a microSD card.\\n* The phone has a quad-camera system on the back, with a 48-megapixel primary sensor, a 12-megapixel ultra-wide sensor, a 5-megapixel depth sensor, and a 5-megapixel macro sensor.

It offers a range of features and specifications that make it a solid choice for users looking for a reliable and affordable device.\",\n",
    " 'The document expresses a preference for BlackBerry (BB) over Samsung, specifically in regards to the ability to eSIM activate on a BlackBerry device, which cannot be done on a Samsung device. The author takes a confrontational tone towards Samsung, indicating a strong opinion or frustration with the brand.',\n",
    " 'The document states that Samsung continues to release new models of smartphones.',\n",
    " 'The document states that the actual demos were not available to display on the Samsung Experience table, and only dummy models for the unlocked version were provided.',\n",
    " 'The document \"Wish me luck (Verizon VPL)\" appears to be a personal message or note, rather than a formal or informational document. It is difficult to summarize its content without more context. However, based on the title and the content of the message, it seems that the author is sharing their excitement or nervousness about an upcoming Verizon Voluntary Program Leave (VPL), and is asking for support or good wishes from the recipient.',\n",
    " \"The document suggests that if electronics retailer Best Buy started selling the newest unlocked model of Apple's iPhone, it would be a very popular and successful move. In contrast, Samsung phones, while still successful, do not generate the same level of excitement or demand on launch days. The document notes that this is not a criticism of Samsung, but simply an observation of the market's preferences.\",\n",
    " 'The document appears to be a fragment or incomplete sentence, and it does not provide enough context or information to summarize. The phrase \"Because they actually come out with new stuff\" is vague and does not clearly refer to any specific subject or context. In order to summarize a document, it is necessary to have a complete and coherent text that provides sufficient information to convey its main points or arguments.',\n",
    " 'The document consists of a single word, \"Hahahaha,\" which suggests laughter or amusement. However, without additional context, it is difficult to provide a more informative summary.',\n",
    " 'The document states that there has been a loss of power, which has resulted in the cancellation of a truck shipment. This development will cause a delay in the launch of a product or service, with 40 pre-orders already affected.

The message does not provide context about the source or specific details about any promotions or trade-in conditions.\\n\\nIn summary, the document appears to be a brief, informal inquiry about trade-in promotions, potentially related to mobile devices, from someone who is not fond of Samsung and empathizes with Verizon salespeople.',\n",

    " 'The document \"How many is so many?\" by Robert Cialdini discusses the principle of social proof in which people tend to follow the actions and behaviors of the majority, assuming that these actions are correct. The document explains how this principle can be used in various situations, such as sales and marketing, to influence people\\'s decisions. The author also warns about the potential dangers of this principle, such as when people blindly follow the crowd even when it is not in their best interest. The document concludes by emphasizing the importance of critical thinking and not automatically assuming that the majority is always right.',\n",

The overall tone of the document is one of surprise and mild criticism of Best Buy.',\n",
