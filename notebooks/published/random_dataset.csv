1181,submission,pnr0ls,t3_pnr0ls,,,,How bad are the Best Buy in North Carolina(or east coast in general)?. I’m thinking about moving from California to North Carolina to be closer to my family. I’m already tired of a lot of things here and think it’s every Best Buy in general but I do love the store and so part of me feels like I should give it a try there. Should I transfer or honestly just start new? Im torn because of the discount and the minimum wage in North Carolina is way less than Best Buy pays.,1,0,1

Your best bet, short of finding someone in your store you can ask (like a designer/in home advisor, or someone known for being zoned in that area), is to read online review sites from credible-ish sources that typically offer reviews of multiple brands as “best of” articles. 

That being said, for the person you described there are high end professional headphones that run $600-700+, though you don’t mention the significance of the three kids. Are they trying to tune out distractions from the kids? You’d want something with ANC then, like the Sony WH-1000XM4 or AirPods Max. There may be pro level sets with ANC but I suspect that’s not a common feature for audiophile purists.",0,0,0

In your situation it seems that they might have been able to avoid some amount of vitriol if they would've just asked people if they would be down to walk away.  Like maybe have a month or two where people could be given info on severance or choosing to change to part-time.  You and others that were wanting/needing to leave would have the chance to do so.  Not sure how many would choose to just leave or change to PT, but would've meant less people would've been purged without warning.  In my department we had at least one guy that was actively wanting to be fired for some reason.  So instead of him just no call no showing and truly fucking us over schedule/appointment wise.  He could've just bounced in a way that actually removed him from our stuff.  Purge might not have been avoided, but maybe it would've.

They must be sent out for repair rather than a payout and fall under the lemon policy where it can be sent out up to 3 times for the same problem before considering a junk out/pay out. The device would have to be far beyond repair and not cost effective to be considered a junk out on the first trip. Read the terms of the protection policy closely because the device is only covered under normal use so claiming it fell out of your monster truck and smashed into unimaginable amounts of pieces would not be covered. Also keep in mind the repair process can take weeks per trip depending on how busy it is,0,0,0

I wasnt able to finish and still have about 3 hours left, but my next shift isnt until a week later. My leader mentioned that I can do the e learnings at home if I want as long as I record my hours, but when I check the TLC there's no log to put in the hours for e learnings. Do I just clock in from home and do it? Or should I just wait until my shifts and expect them to pull me aside to finish them?

I have a friend who worked retail (@ Target) and he told me that they pulled him aside for 1 hour during his shifts just to work on the e learnings, and I was expecting the same for BestBuy. But when the leader mentioned doing it at home, I got confused as to whether they expect you to do it on your own or at work. I just don't want to clock in from home and then get in trouble for doing so.

What I can say is GS has a bit of a harder time when it comes to interactions. People are coming in specifically because something doesn't work and they can't fix it. Unlike coming in and buying a new TV after 10+ years. For this reason there are more upset client's whether you're telling them their manufacturer warranty doesn't cover their 1000$ laptops broken screen, or telling your turn time is 5+ days (unsure of your precincts turn time just an example), or telling then it can take 1-3 weeks for service center repairs. I've had to tell people their cherished memories of loved ones that have passed away are gone because data recovery wasn't successful/possible. What I can say is GS for the most part was the most exciting and loved position I had at BB. There were some terrible times and experiences but the positive and fun outweighed it. I was a top performer as a sales associate (million dollar writer it was called at the time). I left sales and went into GS and spent 7 years as CA/Sr/ARA/GSM. I loved my time with GS and even in those really shitty moments, there were so much good/fun memories I had. I personally say go for it, no longer with the company but from what I have heard sales is a dead end and far more miserable.

1: The discount is HELLA nice. Especially on store brand items. But even when a new game comes out, it's usually cheaper to buy it with your discount than a freshly-used copy from GS.  
2: You'll usually work with some pretty decent people. I worked in Computers and my team was one of the things keeping me there.

Cons:  
1: Hours. If you're not full time, you'll be fighting for them.

That whole 'zero retaliation' thing? That's not real either.  HR will gaslight you into saying the original event wasn't harassment/ abuse so they can circumvent calling it retaliation, and save the person's job. 

I went round with them more than once in my bb days.

1- you will get back on the schedule and have to watch your back at all time 

2- Management will either get fired or ask to resigned from the current position/store

3- you have to sue and the company will settle out of court

4-you have to go to court 

5- you may just give up and walk away and have nothing to show along with no self-esteem to stand up for your rights


trust me I was injury and out work for almost a year and fought to get the surgery that was need with the company and then have fight to get my job back plus I ended up taking the company to court and won. took 2 years but worth it and YES I still work for the company and we have a better and trustworthy management team.

1. Your Dr. gives you paperwork clearing you to go back to work.
2. You call sedgwick and HR and give them the paperwork.
3. Sedgwick and HR take months putting you back in the system.
4. Finally you are active status in the system.
5. Then you get put on the schedule and you have to reset your password. You will probably have to call support because they will forget to give you access to something after you return.

What you probably did was

1. Told your boss to put you on the schedule, so they did.
2. You worked one day and they got in trouble because you weren't made active in the system yet.
3. You are still locked out because you are still on leave.
4. You boss is clueless and no one has advised that you need to contact HR and Sedgwick.

2720,submission,153ukht,t3_153ukht,,,,"Restructuring to Micromarket. The micromarket Company restructure was piloted for about 2 years in NY and essentially became the company  gold standard... The idea is simply put as so - the micromarket would work like one big store (how SWAS was before) however resources are deployable from the Hub store (hence why Hub stores have the most headcount and generally the best of the best)... If a micromarket has 3 stores, picture those 3 stores as 1 big store - that's the idea behind the cuts and deployable labor from the hub store - in so many words, it's like a ""loyalty 1"" but to another store vs another department... From this perspective, you don't need 3 GSMs but 1 Services experience manager (the best GSM supposedly) to run this ""big store"" or MM and the other 2 GSMs would get cut... Evaluations were made based on personal ranking submitted to GM, GM rankings of leaders submitted to MM director (also the hub store GM but not really - they are like a DM of their MM but do have the Hub store as their home location) and then ""in partnership"" with AVP (Marketplace manager, more to come) and HR and 3rd party company (DEI/ESG) - decisions were made on who would stay and who would leave... How those decisions were made were never explained to the individuals getting severance so that was essentially a mystery except to the parties involved in the decision making... Many stores were left in complete shock at who was retained and how the leaders were let go (basically, the leaders were scheduled to work and during their shift, they were given the scripted speech with their severance information, hopes of roles popping open soon in JOS, and being walk out the building without telling anyone what just happened and not being able to say bye to their teams). The main concern with the scheduled sit down severance speeches were to ensure that ""GMs got the store keys back to prevent having to rekey the buildings"" - as far as how the leader felt or having an opportunity to speak to anyone, that was placed at 0% priority or concern.

The Micromarket restructuring started about a year ago and I may have missed a few areas however, in general, this is pretty accurate. 

Corporate: many mergers and cuts occurred there as well, I don't have too many details as that was outside of my wheelhouse however, it was very impactful when I was informed.

Territory, Market, District: essentially all of those leaders and their staff were absorbed into a ""Marketplace"". A marketplace is like 3-4 districts from a legacy perspective (which was like 2 markets to go a little further) and managed by an AVP (assistant Vice President)... So obviously, there were a lot of cuts from the territory, market and district levels (many of those leaders saw the writing on the wall and left beforehand)... Many went the corporate route or multichannel/unit route or home services route (as remote work was and still is overemphasized and overresourced however, still pretty safe in comparison to employees inside 4 walls) and then the rest were simply laid off... Many hundreds of years of tenure gone down the drain.

Field Agents: Essentially cut in half, this happened like a week ago around independence day.

Precinct: GSMs cut (there is one Services Experience manager per micromarket now in store and some stores have a services supervisor but not all). 

Sales: all ASMs cut in half (with the exception of one Hub store per micromarket which may have 2-3 ASM - experience managers as they are called now, will be responsible and accountable for both Sales and Ops and will have a few weeks to learn the ropes). All SSMs cut whether appliances, connected, mobile, etc - they generally got absorbed into the Sup staffing headcount... Sups cut down to 2 or 3 maximum per store with 1 possibly being services supervisor for GSP (again, not every store had this Staffing Headcount - some stores got rid of GSM and the Senior is running the show in partnership with MM services experience manager). From sales, it's safe to say that at least 50% of the leaders were laid off (if you go from the furlough days of pandemic - you can say that 50% advisors have been cut since then as well although, this was not part of the micromarket op model) and what was replaced was a bucket of 40 hours per week per store of labor in leadership bucket for shift leads... If a store has 6 shift leads for example, each will get ""up to"" 7 hours of Shift lead pay per week - some more than others depending on how many managerial tasks/duties they are assigned... Shift leads are essentially supposed to be your ""cream of the crop"" talent (although many stores were amateurishly handing out the position like candy on Halloween - how we used to do with backup VPLs in the past - and now are battling an uphill battle with the selections they made)... The way it should work is that SL get scheduled that labor ""activity"" (as it is not a Job Code per se but more of a skillset you schedule like you would a ""monthly training"" or ""new hire"") after being certified via elearnings and leadership approval in Learning Network... Those SLs should have been the best hourly line level employees and essentially were runner-up for Sup roles or what have you... The problem that is occurring in store now is that, there is a nudge coming from leadership that basically states the following ""a SL performs managerial duties when scheduled; a good SL performs managerial duties when needed; a great SL performs managerial duties at all times"" - the conflict arises when these SLs forget that they still have to contribute to store Performance and Look and Feel causing a ""power trip"" effect and fellow advisors getting upset at their high horse syndrome... Some more intelligent veteran SLs say, ""I will only perform key calls, overrides, MOD resolutions, etc while I'm being paid as SL"" because they are aware that there would be no promotional opportunity any time soon... This will by far be the greatest hurdle for the company as many of these veteran advisors working as SLs are not ""drinking the juice"" and feel that the company cut a plethora of leaders yet the job still remains to complete - end result, the SL must perform and/or verify the task completion for lesser pay than previous Sups and without the name tag title to go along with... Obviously, this causes conflicts among advisors who are not SLs as jealousy or envy or even misunderstanding of the SL role causes internal discomfort and conflicts.

Product flow: essentially now a team which are led by shift leads (on a daily basis however, the EM for each store in partnership with GM and MM director could make a Sup in charge of Ops but not company directive). The traditional daily tasks, Merch, plano, Swat, Truck, etc are all merged into a bucket of labor now - there isn't a direct leader in the warehouse per se simply some SLs unless a MM decides to use a Sup for Ops (highly unlikely yet, some do have a process or Specialty Coach that may be utilized for ""setting direction"" in the MM)... As in the sales floor dilemmas, PF probably has much more as things like Truck night are being led by an able bodied advisor yet, they may back off the actual physical labor and ""manage"" the truck team the whole night... The ""too many chiefs, not enough Indians"" conflict arises (just as it does on the Sales floor) and many of the SLs have slim to no experience in actual people leading to diffuse the conflicts and create reasonable solutions... Again, the greatest issue will be getting the SL program under control as many may confuse the job activity with the job title and feel empowered to believe they are no longer required to roll their sleeves up and work.

Outcome - apparently, NY micromarket stated that it took quite some time to get it figured out but that they love it now... I can say this was said to me by a few GMs when I was doing training with them (they kept winning on many of the scorecards at the time and it sparked my curiosity)... Turnover is expected of course and as cold as that may seem, it's actually calculated and even taken into account with salary compensation for those employees moving forward.

Many are not in favor and feel that these changes and restructurings are occurring so quickly that uncertainty and employee morale are at an all time low... These changes including the changes that occurred with Total Tech (TTS, TT, MBBYTotal, etc) are all signs of amateur leadership from the top or signs of potential financial distress - definitely not well organized or thorough... That would probably be the most accurate assumption today and most employees would leave the company given the opportunity to as they feel the company no longer has its original core values and employee experience at heart... Some feel empowered and some have enthusiasm as they feel that many of the tenured leaders leaving will open up doors for their careers... Who's right? Only time will tell.",1,1,1

It was set to renew and did but somehow it was cancelled from Bestbuy side and cancelled all my warranties on the products I bought in the past. If I buy now they say it will not cover previous items which were covered and would apply to future products only. I went to the store they referred me to their phone number. Their phone number and chat keep deferring me to other departments here and there and 3hrs + I have NOT gotten anywhere! Anyone have any advice?,0,0,0

It sounds like your ""friend"" is a lazy person who demands special treatment already and your management most likely sees her work assignment as fitting compensation for her job performance, no matter how much longer she's been there than you. She can't do anything to you officially, but you may want to distance yourself from her as she may allow her frustration to motivate her to file false things about you, and if I read you correctly, she's already threatening you for making more.

**The discount kicks in after 30 days of employment. Between November 20th and December 31st, however, everyone can make purchases despite their respective hire date.**

Discount is for personal use only, and you cannot disclose your employee purchase price since it is confidential information. Eligible users include you, a spouse/domestic partner, and dependents under the age of 23. Eligible family members can come with and pick-out an item for themselves, but you need to buy it. All non-cash payments must be made in your name. They can't use your Employee number & ID to purchase a product on their own.

To check the discount on an item, copy the SKU and navigate to the Personal tab on ETK. Paste the SKU on the Employee Price Check section. You can learn more about the Employee Discount Policy on 'My HR'.""",0,0,0

It also fails in that they just blame all failings on us, no matter that their decisions are what causes them.  This boot licking of just bending over and taking it that you advise isn't the way that things get better.  Using fear to keep people in line is toxic, demeaning, and unethical.  I refuse to let them keep doing myself and my co-workers so dirty.  All they have to do is ""be human"" and stop abusing us all.  It really isn't hard to just keep in mind that we are people that deserve respect.  They have done shockingly positive things for us workers even just 5 years ago.  So I know it can be done.  What they are doing now is causing burn outs and isn't sustainable given the ways they are cutting staff and effectively making full-timers the same as part-timers with regard to hours.  The way they are going is a great way to make quick money for the top, but will drop hard in the future.  When we are fired because of this, then I fail to see what is worth not doing something.  We will maybe get some small severances, while they will get multi-million dollar ones.  I am guessing that they are trying to somehow be acquired by Amazon with the drastic changes.  If we are being picked off, then we should be coming together and push back.  Believe it or not, I do like the company and want all of us to share in successes that can be had.
