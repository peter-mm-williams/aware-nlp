Also, previous to his promotion to second level, he was in the role myself and the others he\u2019s targeting are: his overall hard on is for micromanaging all of us who are still in the role he used to be in because he wants us to do our work exactly the way he did it. \n\nThe narrative that has developed between the second level and first level supervisors is totally one sided: I have no fair reasonable authority to appeal to.  Their assumptions\/conclusions are based in so many other absurd assumptions on top of others etc.  The first level is like the henchwoman policing mine\/ our every move.\n\n\n\nWhen I ask for feedback on my performance that I\u2019m trying to optimize for delivery to my first level to improve based on her negative feedback several weeks ago: silence from my first level.

Overall I\u2019m glad I switched from private sector, it\u2019s been what I had hoped and I plan to stay a fed gov employee until retirement.\n\nHere\u2019s the rub: I love the work I do but I\u2019m beginning to hate my job more with each passing week. Specifically, I have an overbearing supervisor who was hired several months ago from the private sector, and while this individual is a decent, well meaning person (I think), they\u2019ve been steadily morphing into an egomaniac and their proclivity for bringing their apparent 35 years of private sector management style to bear on me and other fellow subordinates is becoming increasingly intolerable by the week.\n\nToday we had a face to face, one on one and I was left with the impression that one of my coworkers\/fellow subordinates is being targeted for discipline\/write up of a Performance Improvement Plan so they can be micromanaged by this supervisor even more closely and that much easier to either discipline formally and\/or fire.\n\nThis supervisor started insinuating that they\u2019re thinking of initiating the same with me and all my other coworkers\/subordinates who are in the same role (about 8 of us) via a couple of offhand comments on their part: for example they said, \u201cin the meeting minutes I took back on Nov xx, it\u2019s written right here that you said in our planning meeting you were working on xxx, yet here we are a month later and you\u2019re just now finishing xxx up.\u201d\n\nThe meeting began to feel very litigious at that point moving forward to the level that this supervisor started asking me to send her emails I mentioned that would demonstrate why I was delayed -several competing priorities kept surfacing that in my judgement any reasonable person would agree did take precedence in those moments over the past month- and if I could successfully locate them and forward them to her then she wouldn\u2019t have to bring up her concern that I\u2019ve been chronically late producing xxx to her laterals and higher ups.

Anyone have experience with allergy shots while on a FEHB plan? What kind of costs did you see and are there particular plans you\u2019d recommend?\n\nWhile GEHA HDHP self has a $1500 deductive, it also includes a $900 contribution for the year, effectively bringing that down to a $600 deductible. Considering GEHA standard has a deductible of $250, that\u2019s not hugely different. Premiums for GEHA standard are about the same (of course doesn\u2019t have the HSA contribution) Am I going to see a dramatic savings switching off of the hdhp if I end up getting allergy shots? Of course there\u2019s the chance an allergist doesn\u2019t recommend allergy shots, in which case I\u2019d probably wish I had stuck with my hdhp. I\u2019m not 100% committed to GEHA, although I do like it has dental and vision benefits that lets me avoid those other add on insurances.\n\nThanks","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/FedEmployees\/comments\/rdp7sp\/which_fehb_plans_are_best_for_allergy_shots_and\/","reddit_title":"Which FEHB plans are best for allergy shots and testing?

If you left the government now,  you would get 5% of your \"high 3\", the average of your 3 highest years of salary.

Forgive me if this is in the wrong category.\n\nI'm currently on active duty, I've been in for almost 9 years now. I have a few years left on my enlistment. I'm currently shopping for federal jobs with the intent to do an early separation for federal employment. My situation is I want out and want a federal job sooner than later. A couple of co-workers in a neighboring work center are in the process of an early separation. They received federal job offers from the FAA which has a direct hiring authority. They didn't have to apply through USAjobs. Apparently this is good enough justification to get them an early separation. I want to go a similar route but with a different agency.\n\nThe issue I'm running into is almost all federal jobs on USAjobs require a memorandum with my name, date, rank, anticipated discharge character, and service dates to include my anticipated separation date, signed by my commander and good for only 120 days. The issue is I don't have an anticipated separation date within 120 days. I'm going the early separation route, which apparently can get me out in as little as 31 days or as far out as 1 year. I have 2.5 years left. I'm not sure how to go about this or if there is any way to apply for a federal job that requires this document. I've found a few job listings that require a similar document but focuses more on the character of separation and not a date of separation.\n\nAny input would be greatly appreciated.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/FedEmployees\/comments\/evu8jx\/active_duty_air_force_trying_to_find_a_federal_job\/","reddit_title":"Active Duty Air Force, trying to find a Federal job","reddit_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FedEmployees\/comments\/evu8jx\/active_duty_air_force_trying_to_find_a_federal_job\/","reddit_subreddit":"FedEmployees","reddit_link_id":null,"reddit_parent_id":null,"reddit_submission":null},{"aware_post_type":"submission","aware_created_ts":"2020-01-25T15:10:36","reddit_id":"etvuun","reddit_name":"t3_etvuun","reddit_created_utc":1579983036,"reddit_author":"T0rtillas","reddit_text":"","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/FedEmployees\/comments\/etvuun\/tsp_share_prices_012420\/","reddit_title":"TSP Share Prices - 01\/24\/20","reddit_url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/xicndpo0fzc41.png","reddit_subreddit":"FedEmployees","reddit_link_id":null,"reddit_parent_id":null,"reddit_submission":null},{"aware_post_type":"submission","aware_created_ts":"2020-01-18T02:39:33","reddit_id":"eqdjsq","reddit_name":"t3_eqdjsq","reddit_created_utc":1579333173,"reddit_author":"T0rtillas","reddit_text":"","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/FedEmployees\/comments\/eqdjsq\/tsp_share_prices_011720\/","reddit_title":"TSP Share Prices - 01\/17\/20","reddit_url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/663ah6btqhb41.png","reddit_subreddit":"FedEmployees","reddit_link_id":null,"reddit_parent_id":null,"reddit_submission":null},{"aware_post_type":"submission","aware_created_ts":"2020-01-10T21:28:14","reddit_id":"en1eq3","reddit_name":"t3_en1eq3","reddit_created_utc":1578709694,"reddit_author":"T0rtillas","reddit_text":"","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/FedEmployees\/comments\/en1eq3\/tsp_share_prices_011020\/","reddit_title":"TSP Share Prices - 01\/10\/20","reddit_url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/reg356ps82a41.png","reddit_subreddit":"FedEmployees","reddit_link_id":null,"reddit_parent_id":null,"reddit_submission":null},{"aware_post_type":"submission","aware_created_ts":"2020-01-07T13:46:27","reddit_id":"elfq8u","reddit_name":"t3_elfq8u","reddit_created_utc":1578422787,"reddit_author":"T0rtillas","reddit_text":"","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/FedEmployees\/comments\/elfq8u\/so_why_arent_you_a_tsp_millionaire\/","reddit_title":"So why aren\u2019t you a TSP millionaire?","reddit_url":"https:\/\/federalnewsnetwork.com\/mike-causey-federal-report\/2020\/01\/so-why-arent-you-a-tsp-millionaire\/","reddit_subreddit":"FedEmployees","reddit_link_id":null,"reddit_parent_id":null,"reddit_submission":null},{"aware_post_type":"submission","aware_created_ts":"2020-01-05T20:44:37","reddit_id":"ekms01","reddit_name":"t3_ekms01","reddit_created_utc":1578275077,"reddit_author":"T0rtillas","reddit_text":"","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/FedEmployees\/comments\/ekms01\/december_2019_share_your_strategy_and_personal\/","reddit_title":"December 2019: Share your Strategy and Personal Investment Performance (PIP)","reddit_url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/ccqcdn6mb2941.png","reddit_subreddit":"FedEmployees","reddit_link_id":null,"reddit_parent_id":null,"reddit_submission":null},{"aware_post_type":"submission","aware_created_ts":"2020-01-04T05:21:29","reddit_id":"ejv191","reddit_name":"t3_ejv191","reddit_created_utc":1578133289,"reddit_author":"T0rtillas","reddit_text":"","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/FedEmployees\/comments\/ejv191\/tsp_share_prices_010320\/","reddit_title":"TSP Share Prices - 01\/03\/20","reddit_url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/ahdt0fg3lq841.png","reddit_subreddit":"FedEmployees","reddit_link_id":null,"reddit_parent_id":null,"reddit_submission":null},{"aware_post_type":"submission","aware_created_ts":"2019-12-31T19:38:19","reddit_id":"eibhm2","reddit_name":"t3_eibhm2","reddit_created_utc":1577839099,"reddit_author":"T0rtillas","reddit_text":"","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/FedEmployees\/comments\/eibhm2\/tsp_share_prices_123119\/","reddit_title":"TSP Share Prices - 12\/31\/19","reddit_url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/xtombni2c2841.png","reddit_subreddit":"FedEmployees","reddit_link_id":null,"reddit_parent_id":null,"reddit_submission":null},{"aware_post_type":"submission","aware_created_ts":"2019-12-30T00:40:56","reddit_id":"ehhvzn","reddit_name":"t3_ehhvzn","reddit_created_utc":1577684456,"reddit_author":"lazybeekeeper","reddit_text":"Not sure if this question belongs here or not.

The second sub-bullet under the third bullet states that you can keep your FEHB if you have been continuously covered during all of your federal employment since the first opportunity to enroll. If you read that in the most restrictive way, it means situations like the following would render someone unable to maintain FEHB after retirement:\n1)An internship with fed government where an individual didn\u2019t enroll in FEHB because they were covered under parents or university health insurance \n2)A spouse had a job with better benefits, so you switched to them for some period of time before switching back. Even if this was just a year, seems to be a limiting factor. \n\nFinal question on that bullet - is there no time period associated? It seems too open ended from that perspective. \n\nThe guidance with my interpretation of each criteria in brackets:\n\nYou may continue your health insurance coverage only if you meet the following conditions:\n\n-Your annuity must begin within 30 days or, if you are retiring under the Minimum Retirement Age (MRA) plus 10 provision of the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS), health and life insurance coverages are suspended until your annuity begins, even if it is postponed. [I think the point of this is that you can\u2019t just indefinitely postpone your annuity and still use your health insurance.] \n\n-You must be covered for health insurance when you retire. [Ok - straightforward] \n\n-You must have been continuously covered by the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, TRICARE, or the Civilian Health and Medical Program for Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS): [this part gets weird]\n        \nfor five years immediately before retiring;or, [This is basically retiring from the federal government.]\n        \nduring all of your federal employment since your first opportunity to enroll;or, [This one is the source of my question - seems very restrictive.]\n        \ncontinuously for full periods of service beginning with the enrollment that started before January 1, 1965, and ending with the date on which you become an annuitant, whichever is shortest.

Is it possible to attain a federal job abroad with only a high school degree?** My father works with the VA but is a nurse and can't really \"help\" me get in.\n\nBefore my college path was put on hold I was studying international studies. I was learning french and taking political courses. I have experience with a foreign language and with my courses some knowledge of the government. I have retained most of my french (although i'm no where near fluent, I could still read a news article and understand what's going on).  \n\nMy questions are:\n\n* Is it possible to work overseas with only a high school degree? I'm looking to go to Europe. I've seen some jobs like TSA, cook, and I think even babysitter? But can one *really* get theses jobs without a degree? How can I stand out especially? My resume is terrible, I have not worked since like early 2000s and then it was seasonal retail. Advice here?\n\n* I guess logically I'd have to move to DC or NYC if I want to go the political route like this. I'm in Washington state where there is nothing to do. No real volunteer work or anything for experience. How is the climate in DC and NYC for someone with only a high school degree, like could I find work and be able to at least live on my own or is it pocket change? Like I said my resume isn't that great although the most impressive thing is volunteering at my (community) college as President in the language club.\n\nI do plan to continue my studies but in the meantime I'd really love to work for the federal government. With my studies, this would compliment everything I'm seeking to do. My main goal would be to work abroad, and I do have a passport and foreign language experience. I don't care about making a lot, as long as I could make enough to live on my own. Does anyone have and advice or information on this?","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/FedEmployees\/comments\/3c6sgp\/i_only_have_a_high_school_degree\/","reddit_title":"I only have a high school degree.","reddit_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FedEmployees\/comments\/3c6sgp\/i_only_have_a_high_school_degree\/","reddit_subreddit":"FedEmployees","reddit_link_id":null,"reddit_parent_id":null,"reddit_submission":null},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2015-07-06T09:37:33","reddit_id":"csts2c4","reddit_name":"t1_csts2c4","reddit_created_utc":1436189853,"reddit_author":"cloudbuster218","reddit_text":"I too only have a HS degree and I am a Federal Employee at a high GS level.  The most important thing to tool in your arsenal when applying for any job, public or private, is experience.  I had 10 years experience in my field prior to applying and it really offset any need for a degree.  Make no mistake, people do look at that, but in the Federal world it usually isn't an automatic No.\n\nSo get some experience wherever you can and keep applying for jobs in the meantime.  Usajobs.gov is where all gov jobs are posted so check that out.  Also google Federal resume's for some pointers on how to best lay yours out.
