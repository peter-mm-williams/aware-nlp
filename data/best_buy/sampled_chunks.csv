kcvybb5,"With the upmost respect, the employees are really easily replaceable, coming from a former employee. can't tell you how many times I've gotten no service at all while buying high ticket items.  Went in today for a $700 sound system. PCHO was a nightmare with these 18 year olds walking around laughing, cussing with each other and completely ignoring customers in the aisles. Couldn't tell you how many Edgars were there laughing it up in the middle of the department. Made it to home theater and Didn't get a care in the world while the employees stood around chatting with their thumbs up their ass. Left home theater with a ""do you need help?"" after I've already grabbed my item after looking all over for it. This after employees walked right on by. Waited till you saw you could tack on something right? Most of y'all are useless, and coming from a former employee, I was useless too. I embraced it and apparently so do a lot of employees too. Maybe it's karma but I didn't expect a raise for my shit work. Sorry but I don't feel too bad when the raises don't happen when the majority of the store is shit."
izjtvvg,"As far as MY store told me, they have been cutting hours."
kf2lrtn,"Can't find it right this second, however pick time starts from the moment it is in the pick list, to the moment it's staged.  This does not apply to any picks prior to opening. However if the opening picks are still in the list AT time of the store opening to the public, they have the full time applied from the moment it populated to the moment it was staged. So a N/A pick becomes a 2 hour pick. In general as long as it's below 60 minutes, you're fine. If any leader tells you it's 30 or less, then they're making it up for the sake of metrics.   Edit: this time of year the whole idea of 1 hour or less is a joke. Realistically it won't happen. Unless your store is in perfect condition and everything is 100 put away or put back where it all belongs, is received right, planoed right and 0 customers moving stuff around....if you get it under 1 hour, sure. Go nuts. If it's over 1 hour, its not the end of the world. Only thing it hurts is the managers egos and their scorecards."
1aqmruh,this place genuinely makes me sick; I used to be very glad to come into work. I walk in the door and wonder what have they seen me mess up on to get on my ass about. I feel like I will never be good enough for these people/this company. anyways have a good day everyone
iency9m,When I was at best buy during school they was very accommodating to school schedule
m4xdo7,"Fellow BB workers : does anyone know what ""incentive award"" means on our paycheck. All I know is that it isn't that 250/500 most recent bonus. Thank you"
kfd74zj,Whenever I have an issue with a roadie I do a feedback for and that stops them from returning to my store. I once had one come back and threatened me because I did one on him
kgqo8gk,"Correct.  That good way to use membership.   The way you made it sound in your first message the way you sold it to him sounded misleading.   So i can take this adobe 2024 and geek squad going to teach me how to edit my photos/videos?   Do you know how much training a agent gets on any new software?  Zero.  Unless the agents personally use the software themselves in their personal time.  Most agents wont know how to use every specialized software.  Its like asking the guy who makes paint, to paint a picture.   We can do training for computers, proper use, internet safety tips, general questions about Microsoft Office 365, etc etc.  (General Knowledge)   Now, if agent has a idea what program, or software client wants to use.  Some of us will on our personal time, do self training, before meeting the client.  But also some of our agents do come from different backgrounds and they all walk different paths in life, so they have different specializations.   But in alot of cases, if you setup in home appointment, with expectations  that we going to teach client about specific software they purchased, or for in store training (please make sure you note it).  Just double check with your Agent first, before you promise that.   Otherwise you putting the agent and client in very awkward situation."
hko4rw3,You think BBY sells Apple products at no profit?
12ukjb7,Maybe injured?; I was taking down a heavy item from a top shelf and I‚Äôm pretty sure I hurt my back. What do I do?
ktb0d6r,Put in tickets to get them fixed
jy11izg,Just curious do you think they‚Äôll get rid of cs state side all together? I had a lady start working at a store not far from me and she said all USA based people where going to be laid off.
il8oky6,"Yeah pretty much agree with you. I get these kids think it‚Äôs funny but with all the changes companies are going through after the pandemic, labor cuts and everything. They are basically taking up time these employees have to help real customers. Annoying"
k1yl4yi,"The one $200 hdmi cable from rocketfish, $30 w the discount and 4k 120hz"
ki7t4hi,"It feels so rude. ""Whoo I don't wanna go out there it's cold, better make the employees in thin shirts come out and stand outside my car while my dog honks my horn climbing in my lap and I lose my curbside code and make them do ispu from outside :D"""
k18klik,She makes $116.18 *PER MINUTE*.   Record profits are just unpaid stolen wages from the employees.
kc0fxoe,It's outside of your availability! They should know better. They do but don't care to put in effort to actually schedule correctly.
16fgugi,"Employee discount; If I buy plane tickets/ park tickets can I purchase for me and my family? ( I.e children, fianc√© mom and dad ) or is it just for me alone and using my CC"
kr311rj,"Ive gone to all the EMs and supervisors and theyve been helpful and understanding saying that ill get there at some point. I always show up and cover call outs on short notice, from what ive heard they want to keep me for the long run which i dont mind. I love working there just the pressure with PMs and apps is insane if it werent for that i would absolutely love it"
kt6g6kd,"I go from $22 to $16.37 if they don't make sure I'm under WG30.   Have had to have multiple pay checks adjusted because someone who wasn't trained to write schedules wrote schedules and inadvertently took about $250 off my pay.   No worries best buy. I'm not paycheck to paycheck or anything. What's $250 between family, right?"
kf1cg13,"Ha! I've been receiving e-mails at least twice a day since black Friday of sales and such, it never happened before this year."
kp6nh0j,I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs tricking people into it. It‚Äôs giving the customer a visual aid along with the explanation. Sometimes seeing the savings vs hearing it makes a difference.   OP specifically said they void it out when the customer declines. I don‚Äôt see a trick here.
hivpfuz,My GM said they weren‚Äôt sure of the pay raise for the ‚Äòshift lead‚Äô position‚Ä¶ y‚Äôall are getting a pay bump? Our store has yet to pay us more and there‚Äôs like 4 of us doing the shift lead//key holder position üòÉ
ipfos1,Etk down; Etk is down in our store and we had been getting 100-200 picks when oms opens up today is not going to be fun probably going to have around 300 ship to homes by the time the error is resolved
pl1q4b,r/bestbuy is controlled by corporate employees; anyone else think that?
k38ie3j,"It's not professional looking. You might wanna hide them with makeup or a piece of clothing.   Wrong, no. Illegal, no. Write up, no. Not professional looking, yes.  You have an image to maintain when wearing the uniform. You represent not just the company, but yourself.   Getting hickeys all over your neck is highschool behavior.   Just think about it better next time before you do something that isn't a wax on wax off type of situation."
k7fgxb1,Welcome to Best Buy. The dysfunction will continue
kr1kpri,My thoughts exactly
k18l1y3,"Exactly, and this is why I hope the WGA/SAG/UAW strikes work. It's why I hope the efforts at Starbucks continue to drive change there. Why I hope those actions inspire others to try and take back control of their lives from the people who truthfully need us far more than we need them."
jkuc0wq,"This already happened to us awhile ago, with the whole Micro-market restructure.   Our stores are just GM, EM (Experience Manager), Experience Sup, (Some have two or three) GSM. So I wonder if they‚Äôre still cutting GSM because I‚Äôve heard that they might be pushing for there to just be *one* GSM per MM."

k9fh11n,Your store sucks. Every year we get good catering.
jk4p0mz,"What you don‚Äôt understand is that the TT pricing that‚Äôs lower than employee cost is because they are either selling it at a loss as a sales driver with the expectation of attaching more margin favorable items or the manufacturer is providing back end revenue to support the sale price and paying out ‚Äúbounties‚Äù per unit sold. Ad prices and things listed on our main page get ‚Äúspiffs‚Äù for the company when sold so although our direct cost is not impacted or changed for that product we make more from the vendors. Vendor support(manufacturers paying us more for selling their items when we meet their goals, only Corp knows what they are) accounts for a high percentage of profit for the company. It‚Äôs not just sales and margin."
kruaeyf,yeah that seems weird of the EM man. sorry that‚Äôs happening.
jq4mggv,"Well yes, that's part of the ""leveling up."" Right after he gave that warning, someone else presented a slide about the responsibilities shifting down.  But it's not a job you apply for. You can't put a job posting for ""shift lead"". It's just e-learning certifications that allow me to schedule someone in shift lead tasking.  It's a technicality that allows the company to avoid admitting  they expect everyone to do more work for less pay.    So you get things like my AVP and MD going ""we're not giving more work, just spreading out responsibilities"" but then my MD turns around and says ""Maybe we get to a point where shift leads are doing QCs, interviews, and writing schedules"""
k44gsbf,"Omg I‚Äôm a fellow tech, please find out what happened for us!"
wylhu9,Questions about online interview; So I did the online interview about 5 days ago am I supposed to get any email confirming that it has been turned in it‚Äôs been on my mind the past few days it said everything was submitted and that I can close the page but I haven‚Äôt received any emails at all and wonder if I did something wrong.
ksbwuta,But making $17.37 is not enough to be ‚Äúthe manager‚Äù
170i31u,how do i add my discount to the bb app ?; since it updated it‚Äôs removed my employee numbers from the app and i don‚Äôt know how to add it back :/ i‚Äôve been using the discount tool on bbyconnect but want to make an online order.
15t3heu,Funny how; I can get PMs and BPs but when it comes to mobile either cheap ass ppl or just plain assholes wouldnt like to get accessories for their phones or gps like you are dropping literal thousand of dollars on the phone a hundred for accessories aint gonna kill you even though i push push push and cant force anymore to the customer i get reemed out about my ‚Äúpoor‚Äù basket performance‚Ä¶are you fucking serious?
i4s8y4q,I've had a varied experience with different managers. The purchasing of PTO is just extra unnecessary steps so it feels like something sneaky is afoot. One year I miscalculated 1 hour of PTO to use it up before reset since it doesn't roll over and went negative. BBY FORCED an 8 hr (full day) PTO purchase on my paycheck.
ktjzis4,Well congratulations we gavent heard anything at all
ggrsuk0,We got paid last Friday. If you‚Äôre in a location with an alternate pay schedule I‚Äôd expect it to post early or on Friday as normal. It‚Äôs all electronic and submitted usually on Tuesday.
kfzb1zo,i'll be 100% frank with you since you're seasonal you're gonna see absolutely no hours. even part timers are scheduled like 2 days in 3 weeks. truthfully i'd look for another job. You'd know if you were fired.
jx4kjzw,"At least one of us on my team, manager or otherwise, will mention possible severe weather at least once throughout the day. My AM and team are one of the few good things the company has going for it still"
jsaat66,That‚Äôs a good idea too üëÄ
138xt52,"Digital Imaging Accommodation. Where did it go?; In ETK you were able to find the D.I. accommodation with relative ease. Does anyone know where it has moved to? I've checked learning network, the connect app, employee resources andjob resources with no luck. If anyone knows anything about it, it would be greatly appreciated."
jqqajnp,Get comfortable with just that.  I used to love the company but when I was told I couldn't coach and train as a supervisor it was rough.
j4e78p8,The fact that we have more managers on the floor than sales reps most says is mind boggling and then all they do is pass the customers over to us as if we don't already have 5 customers waiting on us smh üòí
hfeqtc2,"You'll be expected to do the job of 4 others plus your own.  You'll get more hours if you are part time because they don't want to pay people benefits.  You'll be basically by yourself. If you're in fulfillment you're held to almost impossible pick rate times, ships, and curbside pick ups while still expected to help customers.  Most departments in the store only have 1 or 2 people working at a time.  You can find a job somewhere else that probably pays more and will give you less stress.  A lot of current Best Buy employees are overworked.  I've been with the company for almost 10 years and I am too depressed to do anything other than work, sleep, and eat.  Personally my mental health took a massive dip back in August of last year and has been declining rapidly ever since."
