But I’m definitely seeing the sales floor get hit with the, “ we have too many employees and not enough hours” while at the same time being severely understaffed in everything we do.most sales associates get 10ish hrs per week. Customers wait about 20 min to get helped. And what’s best is when they have geek squad at the register because they need “help” and then yell at us for NPS sucking cause our work didn’t get done.

}",0,"Ehh I can see them upset at us because we have a more efficient precinct than many I've seen. Our function checks are always between 0-5 as we do them the moment they come through. I know when a customer is buying something or not, and many times I'll function check small stuff while they are blabbing their story. Average around 2 totals a day usually on top of that. If a customer is going on too long I let them know we gotta end it there for the 20 min consult. Our ARAs prefer to call clients. Etc. This results in us having SO MUCH free time while still making more labor than we spent (we are positive labor for a while now and even donating our hours). We also do not help code 1's because corporate told our managers we are not to do that. (Our managers were making us do customer service ALWAYS, and so we emailed HR and forwarded our managers asking about it. HR replied and told us that customer service and front lanes are NOT in geek squads job responsibilities. Because of that they refuse to even call us for code 1's. Always remember if you are being taken advantage of, make a paper trail and ask hr if it's allowed. The moment they say no, your store will back off entirely.) So many times we are found doing nothing in the back being lazy and having fun :) but every store member knows they can come to us for anything, we often will buddy up and help our store associates sell a total by them bringing their client to us to ""techy explain"" some technology or benefits. We never turn that down. But if we did all our job responsibilities, I'm sorry we aren't responsible for doing things outside our job description and we wont. Just as it's not blue shirts fault we are understaffed often. It goes higher."

}",0,"No it’s not technically within your job description. If you feel you’re being treated outside of policy, it might be good to file an HR claim.  Seeing as how the company in general has adopted the mindset of “do more with less,” they’re not likely to heed your request though 😕 Especially since the most recent snap, all team members have been asked to “flex” to multiple departments for help. That includes recently snapped managers that are now sales team, but still have to act as managers.  As an ARA myself with limited staff and a constant high demand (recently had over 30 items in repair), I push back against management as much as I can. It doesn’t always work, but standing up for your clients is good ethics. Please pick your battles carefully though… A few strategies are:  - Offer to help briefly to answer questions or assist with a sale. Outright resistance is subordination, and will not be taken well. Work with them and they should work with you (though I know many managers are unreasonable…).   - Politely decline to be posted at an answer center. If no sales person is available, clients can work with a leader (who should be leading by example btw), or wait in queue like we do during the holidays.   - Remind them that NPS may tank due to extended repair times.   - Clients we have promised to work for take precedent over new clients. While we can’t outright refuse to help someone without just reason, we should not be taking on more than we can handle, nor should we jump the queue. We work on an appointment based first-come first-serve basis, and take walk-ins as time permits."

We had six managers, 12 supervisors, many seniors, and full timers.  I went through the reorg in 2009 and barely kept my position. Supervisors drop to five, managers drop to four.  My stress gave me ulcers.  Our goals got to unrealistic math levels.  In gaming we had to have 8% service plans, accessories 12.5%, 3% geek squad set up services for consoles ($30 to turn the system on and run updates lol).  I had done the math at the time and management was unpleasant with me when I said this was not possible. Nintendo Wii accessory sales when we had no wii remotes 70 nunchucks.  Assuming we literally sold geek squad, black tie protection on each possible device we would not hit our numbers.  And that’s assuming that customers come in and literally buy everything we tell them to.    Speaking of more unrealistic, I was told on a Monday morning to replace all of the price tag’s in gaming, because the wordage for performance replacement, plan (PRP) was rebranded to geek squad black-tie protection replacement plan (GSBTPRP).  I remember telling them that it wasn’t going to happen today and they got upset. Then I used math to show them that approximately 30 4ft sections of games, each having six shelves, minimum seven tags per row assuming that each game magically had its own spot on the shelf and wasn’t stacked in front of another game.  Telzon taking about 10sec per tag in our shitty faraday cage of a store.  Takes about 10 sec to remove old tag and put on new tag.  35 hours of labor assuming the tag printer doesn’t jam, zero customers need help, etc.  and all of this was less than 24 hours after an adset, so basically we had to redo adset is what corporate wanted.  management hated me.  Then there was the gaming initiative in 2011 where I was so optimistic that things were turning around.    At this point I was trying to raise a family and thought this would actually be my career.

Especially if we had to deal with the factory warranty and put up with their bullshit. We would do a triage, and that wouldn't fix the TV all the time. Then, they would send part after part  until it was past 30 days or if the cost was BER (Beyond Economical Repair) on their end. Before I left, a poor elderly client was still waiting to get his Sony tv replaced after almost 3 months of multiple agents trying to fix it, but Sony wouldn't replace it. Sony's are great when they work, but after having to deal with them for 5 years on repairs and the headaches they have given us and clients. I refuse to buy a Sony TV. I would rather buy myself an LG OLED any day. It is much easier to deal with and easy to fix. I also didn't have to repair a lot of them. Samsung, I did repair the most, but those repairs are not a problem at all. They were the easiest to repair, but like I said, they do get serviced a lot. If you're going to get a Sony, then get the GSP plan. The process through the Geek Squad was simpler than the factory warranty but still a pain in the ass to fix. Sorry for the paragraph. I can say a lot more, but I bet no one is reading this far.  TL:DR - Sony is a pain in the ass to deal with for this repair agent."

Helping people find what they need, not just what they think they want, solving the never ending problems in the electronics world and building bonds with customers. I have customers still to this day I've been helping since 2013. I've seen their kids grow up and seen some of them go off to college. I've learned a lot, grown a lot and tried to help those around me grow as well. I have gone through a lot with the company like cut backs, mass hiring, many holidays. I had an ASM Ramon who I could easily say was such a supportive and amazing person to guide paths for so many. 2018 I went through something that took a lot out of me mentally (my mom got really sick) and by 2019 she had left this world. Some of my Best Buy experience during this time was supportive. Being a person who had to take caregivers leave when it first released was a learning experience, asking for LOA when she went to hospice was disparaging when it was declined cause I didn't have the right paperwork, only to lose my mom before they approved it. Telling my GM I needed more time than the bereavement time allotted because I was going through a large amount of depression and anxiety and having him support me taking time. Making so many friends and watching them leave for school or other jobs. I was there for 24/7, Total Tech Support, Total Tech to even the new plan. Rallying behind decisions that obviously I have no control over but hoping to inform customers the best way I can. The moral has been so down lately and it takes a toll on the brain. Constant red floors due to lack of staff, people leaving, the grind for memberships (which I don't mind but I do feel like since I deal with so many repeat customers what more can I do if they have already gotten the credit card from me or the TTS to TT and conversions). I love helping customers and getting to learn about their lives. I just feel run down. Everyone is mad about the changes and most will just tell me if you aren't happy"

I give them a year or so and we will see them continuing to fade away. Looks like many of use will be taking our hard earned cash elsewhere. See what they do when they start loosing the high dollar accounts. I really wish some of my local camera stores had more stock but maybe it’s time to get back to the store and show them That customer service will bring us back and continue to spend thousands a year locally.   I can’t remedy the last time I’ve been able to actually find something in store and not have to order it. Even then I’ve had 3 high dollar orders over $3000 cancel on me after placing the order.
