Those who remain were forced to convert into other positions and operations has basically died in best buys eyes.... because they killed it intentionally.   Those who remain are typically new hires or senior staff who are trying to hold it together. The leadership we have now are sales leaders....the people who have 0 experience with operations yet think they know everything, yet know nothing. It won't get any better. Give up hope and lower your expectations. Me and a few others are holding it together but are in the same boat. The only saving grace with me and my peers is our work ethic  and the need to have a functioning warehouse because it affects us more than the sales floor. It's rough, but we're holding it together. Don't rely on your leadership, rely on your peers. It's the only way you'll survive the holiday season. A few good players can hold the fort down, against all odds."

}","Thank you for the response. But chicken guy is popular. I swear I recognized the chickens.   But, in browsing, around, I found a wonderful excell file with lots of names and contacts of 3pl and a good amount of their structure. At least from the view from bestbuy. It's an old by about a year and a half, but yea.   I believe you in that you get the right email to the right person, you can get accountability.  The problem is the availability and knowledge to execute that path towards correcting 3P.  The lack of readily available info, seems very purposeful (which it likely is)  With how easy it is to find store information, then leadership information, etc of bestbuy grown employees, it really should be equally accessible for getting information and coaching to 3pl to fix issues.   Also,I'm looking for numbers. Bestbuy employee customer care is dwindling in favor of 3PL. I'm very curious what metrics leadership is using to justify this move.   If I had to guess. They are looking at heavily at call length and transfer and not much else. That's the only way 3pl can beat home grown CC. I know while I was in that world, when I got someone who had been ran through the call center transfer rodeo, I took as much time as needed to get the customer taken care of. Productivity on paper would be sacrificed, but a customer was taken care of.   If that gap in awareness or recognition that Home based BBCC are more likely to resolve the customers issues which usually means longer times on the phone with the customer, then that's a problem. And, imo, that's what the trend leads me to believe is happening. Some pencil pusher is just seeing black and white data and making calls off of that, or they have a leader who's even more disconnected from the actual problem making quick judgment calls.   I'm seeing that level of leadership through ignorance from market level to store level, so it isn't much of a stretch to believe that's also what is driving decisions concerning home based CC reps and 3pl ones."

Not only betrayed, but lied to in being told and made to feel like you matter, only to find out that you don't?   I'm really questioning whether I should stay with the company. My GM had me do the lead e-learn so I can key hold during the holiday to get an extra bump in pay, but why should I have to take on extra responsibility to make what others would make without having to take on those responsibility, simply because I've been here longer?   Does this seem insane to anyone else, or am I upset about nothing?"

Don’t forget to use your phone to show them the deals and ask them if they’re upgrading their laptop or if someone in their family will. If they ever hit you with a “I don’t buy here a lot,” still tell them that the Plus membership is perfect for them because with one purchase they can make their money back. Or tell them that that is the reason why they created that membership. Practice that and try to make your pitch as short as possible since people at checkout tend to just want to leave fast.

If you haven't yet, try calling the insurance to work it out and see if there are other options available.

}","In your spare time if you have a chance to do some of the E learning, I have found that it helps me become more familiar with some of the products. There are times where certain products I won’t know anything about or what it is but I just look up on my Best Buy app and try to find the product or something similar so I can point them in the right direction. For the E learning I try to find things I’m more interested in so I can retain the information better or at least if I am not familiar or interested I know of the brand and I have somewhat of an idea what they are talking about. For example, some customers will ask me about CORSAIR and I am not an expert on that whatsoever but I was able to lookup what they needed with the SKU number or brand name and point them in the direction of the isle. When they ask me specific questions about the product I try to resonate with them and if I honestly don’t know the answer I will look it up or try to pull up the features tab on the app under the product information to see if anything in there will answer their question. It can be a pain because the customer has to wait for me to answer but usually they appreciate the effort and if they get upset I usually just be like “I’m sorry I am not super familiar with this product but I can pair you up with someone who would know more about it if you up to wait until they are available to help you” so it doesn’t sound like I’m completely helpless."

}","Not quite a Sony OLED owner but I see you asked twice and I feel I have some insight. I got an S95B demo for a scorching deal. But I've spent a lot of time with the Sony's. They are probably the least bright OLED right now. But I'd say they are suitable for any room where blinds can be drawn. Ideal for darker spaces.  Sony prioritized accuracy of intent more in their image processing resulting in a sometimes less saturated and cool image than their competition, especially in a more vivid picture mode. You do still get reflections though, being able to see light fixtures and stuff . But you can't get rid of that without a matte display.  And that would suck for the contrast. Some of the competition is brighter or has better anti glare. But Sony is pretty good in both departments and is awesome in its own regard. Just compared based on preference, price and picture in person and features"
