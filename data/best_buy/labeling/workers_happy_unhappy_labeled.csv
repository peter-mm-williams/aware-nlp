}","all day doing other things.  They are turning more stores into just warehouses, the staff is trained to hand the customer off to a sales consultant or sr sales consultant. So it makes the worker feel less important. A lot of people are taking pay cuts to leave. In my store alone I can name 6 off the top of my head and more looking for other work. ALL of which where the best employees in the store.   My store went from 7 to 2 designers. One of which was a “straight” man who asked me to have sex with his wife while he watched. Turns out he’s also both gay and straight. He’s had multiple sexual harassment accusations. Our store had a new GM take our store over and right before the switch. This GM had known the gay cuck for “years” Turns out he’s doing the interviews. Again, I was one of the top networking designers in the country, but he sold more TVs and sound-bars than me. I made the company more money, he sold more entry level product.   They promoted the gay cuck  Try to get me to hand my clients over to him.  My clients were CEOs, Lawyers, Real-estate investors. They were loyal to me. Repeat clients   His customer was a kid who’s parents own a small phone repair store that bought brackets and entry level TVs from him.   Best Buy is a who you know - blunt force object that pushed all their skilled workers out because they think they don’t need them. The majority of their money comes from online purchases.

Then Best Buy is the job for you, because you'll never have time for those things, and they don't care! They own you, and they'll make sure you know it.   Want time off? Good luck! Especially around the holidays. They lose so many employees and are constantly understaffed because of the horrible way they treat people. But guess what? Because you stick around its your job to make up for their inadequacy! So don't you dare ask for time off. But watch the GM's come and go as they please, working ""half days"" or pretending they showed up at 6am to leave at 2pm on a Saturday, or scheduling full weeks ""working from home"".   Customers get to treat you like shit. They yell and cuss at you and Best Buy will just allow it. Better thicken up that skin before your shift.   Want a regular schedule so you can plan your life? HA! Your schedule will NEVER be the same week to week (except to know you work at least 6 days a week). If you are lucky enough to get 2 days off, they're split. And your shifts will look something like; 10am-8pm, 11am- 10pm. I'd love someone to genuinely explain how you have a life with those kinds of shifts 6 days a week. You will never have a weekend day off ever again.   Bottom line, Best Buy exhibits behavior that their employees are expendable and replaceable. Its clear they no longer see a value in people at all. Probably because they realized during 2020 they could make more money moving their platform online.

We then moved to another location, the company revamped numerous times and the sole purpose was to shill credit cards.  Managers lied to customers and then brought the customers to us only to have the customer pissed at us because the managers were dumb.  I was a VPL in home theater but was told I had to sell everything and work in other departments. I then moved to mobile as the att vpl and ended up having to work in every department when managers didn’t do anything, they “weren’t allowed” to help customers, but instead had the queue system which barely worked. We were told in mobile that we were replaceable, but nobody other than the vpls and a few select other people know how to activate phones and service them. The managers tried and failed at phone activations and left the pissed off customers for the vpl to deal with.

}","Well, I worked there for 4 years. 3 of being in the highest ranked sales position in the company (MDC/System Designer) my reasons were pretty well the same grievances company wide. My reasons were compounded by favoritism and sexual harassment. Note** MDC was 100% commission based. You could make ALOT of money if you’re a closer (I am, was one of the top network designers in the country)  Best Buy recently made the largest restructuring they’ve had in over a decade. This roll out was through the pandemic and VERY ROUGH.   They went from hourly, specialized departments to hourly+commission store wide sales consultants. Meaning the sales people had to step out of their “comfort zone” and learn other parts of the store they were not familiar with. This new business model included in-home “Sr. Sales Consultants” that would advise customers in their homes. On paper and in theory this is a smart move. A personal touch higher paid sales people that are more knowledgeable.   The problem with that is there are only a few guys skilled enough to do these roles and worked mainly on the MDC department along with a handful of Best Buy “In home advisors” which were just more entry-level system designers. When they rolled everything out they stripped the majority system designers of their titles, made them focus on lesser products and learn the entire store. And high end or high level jobs would go to the 1 or 2 designers that would then take on everyone’s workload.   It was stressful as hell It was demoralizing being stripped of a prestigious title. It made us feel like a number in a machine  I personally was offered a pay cut and they tried to make me feel excited about it. (Most got raises, more on that later.) THEN MADE ME WORK MORE! The rest of the store basically got pay raises and demoted. It’s what it felt like. Payed more to eat more shit.  They stopped caring about the things that made the work place fun and focused heavily on subscription based services (TTS) and coached primarily on that. And getting credit cards. The important managers (GM/SSM) are rarely in the store to address concerns and the company has them hide behind a computer all day doing other things.  They are turning more stores into just warehouses, the staff is trained to hand the customer off to a sales consultant or sr sales consultant. So it makes the worker feel less important. A lot of people are taking pay cuts",1081,"Does this statement reflect sentiment about Best Buy? Label the sentiment as positive (1), negative (-1), or neutral/irrelevant (0)."

}","Funny stories (current and ex-employees) about of Best Buy miss?; I worked at BB as a Computer Sales Associate for 9 years in the 2010s and left at the end of 2020.  I remember how shitty the company was before Hubert Joly and thoroughly enjoyed all of the things Hubert did to improve all of the stores, including but not limited to cutting executive staff before loval leadership.  Stores back then had a family/friend atmosphere. Our store was the Wild West. We hooked up an iPod to the store’s speakers and would play music throughout the day and whoever got a Best Buy card, that associate could change the music station. (Pro tip: turning on Christmas music in July caused employees and customers to riot and complain to me to change it hahah)  Two employees got into a ball tag war where they’d randomly try and hit each other in the nuts while working. It spread like wildfire throughout the store.   An employee poached someone else’s sale that they had been working on for almost two hours that was $2k+. The employee who lost the sale walked by the poaching employee with a Game of Thrones box set and swung the box set up into the employee’s ball sack and caused the employee to drop to the ground. The employee took over and got his original sale back while the customer was dying of laughter.  It all ended when an employee was hit in the balls with a pair of airpods while carrying a 30 lb printer down the ladder and fell off and broke the printer haha. HR came in and inquired with everyone and everyone protected each other and didnt say anything, but the GM, who was a G, admitted it happened and laid on the grenade for all of us and got probation. We took him out and bought him some beers afterwards.  When the Force Awakens came out, there was a huge snow storm that effectively kept us from going  home so we all walked to the local movie theater where they gave us a special, free showing of Star WRs until the roads were plowed and salted.  We hooked up our phones to the bluetooth speaker demo products and would wait for the manager to walk through the department and contact customers in that section and then turn on a fart app and have the speaker loudly fart next to the manager haha.

}","Then there was the gaming initiative in 2011 where I was so optimistic that things were turning around.    At this point I was trying to raise a family and thought this would actually be my career. But then we didn’t receive enough labor for our team full-time or had to work 32 1/2 hours supervisor 37 minimum.  We had two part-timers that got about 12 hours each.  Best Buy was talking about how bad shrink was and gaming, just like it always has been, and just like it always will be, but we did not have the labor to be staffed during each open hour.  Not to mention any labor for truck, adset, etc.  Then my position was removed August 2012.  The writing was on the wall.  I could either take severance or any of the available full-time positions that would exist.  Problem is there are three stores in our area, not counting the Best Buy mobiles.  So it was a dog pile of people for one or two positions that paid less than what we made five years ago at that point.    I took the severance, eight years of professional workmanship gone.  but a lot of my former friends and colleagues were still stuck on the Best Buy train wreck.  I joined this sub Reddit just to see how things have been going but it’s not very optimistic. Most of my bad dreams have been of regular work at Best Buy.  Now, almost everyone I know is out of Best Buy and has long since moved on. Years ago, Best Buy got rid of 401(k), matching I remember reading. Which is the most petty way of saying we don’t care about our employees and we are pretending that this is a cost savings measure.  The few old coworkers that remained said that they are sharing a manager between multiple stores. Almost nobody is full-time. They have like two supervisors. Which means some key holders are literally part time, so have no stake in the company.  All risk no reward.  Pay is capped at comical levels.  I just needed to get all that off my chest.

}","Let Go Today; I was informed today that I was being terminated due to attendance violations. (Being late, not calling out or no call no showing). It’s been quite the experience over the last 20 months. The people I’ve worked with, especially in product flow are some of the funniest, most hard-working people I’ve ever known, and I was honored and privileged to work alongside them.   With that being said, Best Buy, as a corporation, is completely and utterly fucked. Starting at the top, Cori Berri is one of the worst executives I’ve ever heard of. She constantly takes this company and drives it into the ground. It almost seems intentional at this point. She is a fucking idiot and I wouldn’t trust her to run a lemonade stand, let alone a huge corporation.   To one of my managers in particular, you are an asshole. Plain and simple. You constantly call people out over the walkie for stupid things, knowing damn well that it could’ve been a 1on1 conversation, or one that didn’t need to occur in the first place. Instead, you sit on your ass or stand at the AP and belittle people. Idgaf how long you’ve worked there, you’re a dick and I hope you eat shit. You constantly bring morale down throughout the store and then wonder why people don’t have good attitudes.  To the managers, STOP INTERRUPTING CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN SALES FLOOR AND CUSTOMERS. It has to be the most deflating thing in the world when you’re having a good conversation with a customer, selling them product, learning about them and their interests, and then hearing over the walkie, “oo (salesperson’s name), looks like a good membership opportunity”. I hear that and I can feel the balloon being deflated. Fuck your stupid memberships, fuck your stupid credit cards, 99% of customers don’t want it and you make the interactions worse by shoving it down their throats.   With that, Best Buy needs to bring back specialization. One of the biggest complaints that customers have is that “your sales floor doesn’t know shit about the product.” Well, how could they? Best Buy wants sales floor to be experts on thousands of products. You know what happens when you try to be an expert on everything? You’re an expert on nothing. It’s simply impossible.

}","Left Best Buy After Six Years; Some Tips and Advice for those Employed.; 1. Work hard, but not too hard. If you’re trying to get promoted within your store then personal performance matters, but it doesn’t in the eyes of corporate. Being likeable by others is often more important than your numbers when it comes to promotions.  2. Your experience in retail will vastly be determined by the managers at the store. If you don’t like your management, look for another store in the area and switch over. The extra 10 minute drive is worth not hating your life every single day you clock in.  3. There is no job security in retail. The position you’re working now will most likely not exist in another year or two. If you can’t constantly adapt to new roles, stores, and responsibilities, then retail isn’t for you. (This isn’t exclusive to BBY)  4. Don’t be afraid to apply for positions you don’t feel qualified for. I got a work-from-home corporate position after being in retail for a long time with no degree; again, you need to be likeable by others.  5. Steer clear of post-military employees, specifically those in management roles. They take their jobs way too fucking seriously and you don’t get paid enough for that bullshit. This isn’t the Marines, it’s Best Buy for Christ’s sake.  6. Stand up for yourself. I see too many people get walked over by others at this job.  7. Don’t fuck with the installers; be nice to them. Leave notes on your orders. The installers are your best friends if you take care of them, I’ve had many go back to job sites and clean up some of my mistakes on orders. They’ll save you from many angry customers.  8. Don’t fuck with the Geek Squad employees either. See above point for reference.   9. HR doesn’t mess around. In 99% of cases it’s so much easier for them to fire someone. If you actually use the HR hotline as you should, you will see someone lose their job (provided you have a valid case).  10. You may see your position as a career, but corporate does not. The reality is that 99% of retail positions have high turnover rates, and corporate treats them this way.  11. The current sales model is extremely broken and a far cry from what it used to be at Best",4848,"Does this statement reflect sentiment about Best Buy?

The leaders at Best Buy don’t really lead. They see the title and just bark orders or come over to “help”. Most don’t deescalate issues with customers and they don’t know how or they seemingly don’t escalate order issues. They never tell new hires or advisors information about the store or company until it’s last minute and by then it’s too late. They will also tell new hires the wrong information. Our new Assistant GM told a new hire we don’t use SKUs for our Apple products when product flow and all advisers on the floor do use SKUs when looking for Apple products.

}","Rant Time!; Rant time!  I work in mobile and my store gets so busy throughout the day, most days, and we are so understaffed due to corporate not only extending our operating hours, but also taking away around 8 hours of labor from our department, that I am working back to back with customers that have been waiting in the queue for 20+ minutes.   What this leads to is most mobile associates not being able to take our California government required 10min rest breaks.   I’m not sure about other states, but in California we are apparently supposed to get paid an extra hour of labor at our regular rate for each break we are not given and even though nobody at Best Buy explicitly says “no you can’t take a break”, it is  heavily implied that we shouldn’t (especially when we are super busy).   Best Buy reports record profits but keeps cutting labor which puts the pressure even more on us because we have to keep picking up the slack for missing coworkers, which is also leading to an ever decreasing moral and mental health of employees, leading to more call outs and even more missing labor.   Best Buy corporate needs to either start hiring more people or implement break tracking with TLC to make sure employees are getting properly compensated for missing breaks. While employees own a certain amount of responsibility to make sure they take their breaks, the company owns even more of that responsibility as they don’t schedule enough people in specialized departments like mobile, who can cover for breaks.   So assuming you’ve been working full time for Best Buy for a few years and how many breaks you have been forced to skip due to low coverage. 40 breaks? 100 breaks? So many you don’t even know what a break is anymore?  If the company minimum wage is $15/hr, how much money has Best Buy stolen from you? One hundred breaks at minimum wage is $1500, granted a decent chunk of that is taxed and I don’t know about you, but shoot I sure could use the rest for bills.

That would be your fifth reason for the dip in applicants.   I also found this quote hilarious: ""*it's about a wholesome set of benefits that we can put in place*""  Really? What benefits do PT workers get? No medical/dental/vision, no PTO to speak of (but routinely near full-time hours). I guess they can buy BBY stock at a discount in the ESPP program? Wheeeeee.   And when you say ""and flexibility that we can put in place"" it rings more like you want to cut people from 39 hours to 4 hours with little notice, but also want them to come in on their scheduled days off on short notice too. How does this benefit the customer Corie? What is your endgame here?

If you are bored enough to read my stupid life story:  I was part of the grand opening team for a Best Buy in 2006.  35,000 ft.² I was full-time media, basically a senior, but without the actual position or pay.  We had six managers, 12 supervisors, many seniors, and full timers.  I went through the reorg in 2009 and barely kept my position. Supervisors drop to five, managers drop to four.  My stress gave me ulcers.  Our goals got to unrealistic math levels.  In gaming we had to have 8% service plans, accessories 12.5%, 3% geek squad set up services for consoles ($30 to turn the system on and run updates lol).  I had done the math at the time and management was unpleasant with me when I said this was not possible. Nintendo Wii accessory sales when we had no wii remotes 70 nunchucks.  Assuming we literally sold geek squad, black tie protection on each possible device we would not hit our numbers.  And that’s assuming that customers come in and literally buy everything we tell them to.    Speaking of more unrealistic, I was told on a Monday morning to replace all of the price tag’s in gaming, because the wordage for performance replacement, plan (PRP) was rebranded to geek squad black-tie protection replacement plan (GSBTPRP).  I remember telling them that it wasn’t going to happen today and they got upset.

Telzon taking about 10sec per tag in our shitty faraday cage of a store.  Takes about 10 sec to remove old tag and put on new tag.  35 hours of labor assuming the tag printer doesn’t jam, zero customers need help, etc.  and all of this was less than 24 hours after an adset, so basically we had to redo adset is what corporate wanted.  management hated me.

}","Lack of retention; So I’ve been working for Best Buy for a couple months now. I don’t mean to sound like a showboat, but this will help my overall point: I was the top salesman last month and am on track to do even better numbers this month, all in my first three months.  Im an occasional/seasonal employee, and yet my employer is giving me full time hours. Im hitting overtime this week and next week, and by no means am I complaining. But something I’ve noticed is that they’re cutting hours on employees that have been here for years. A full time employee is receiving 25-30 hours to cut labor hours and im receiving 38+ each week.  While I understand that this is a “performance based position,” my colleagues have seemingly bashed me for undermining their hours when all im doing is my job. In my first three months, I’ve seen full timers leave because of labor cuts, not just on the sales floor, but product flow just as much.  Best Buy really needs to work on incentivizing with their employees better.  At this rate, I’d have much better pay at an actual commission based job and probably be appreciated more.

It doesn’t cost jobs to reduce the time customers spend in store, it’s costs job for them to stop making the in store experience any good.   People didn’t stop going into bestbuy because curbside became and option, prior to curbside there was store pickup customers, who notoriously didn’t spend money in store anyways, so they just added to the queue in store and took in store resources at customer service, moving a portion of that to curbside which doesn’t need someone trained in customer services and returns (CS staff means that the store can borrow from warehouse or other non-customer roles).  The biggest loss of jobs was removing decent training for the Sales rolls, reducing staff in record profit years, and choosing profit over staffing. BestBuy was a much better shopping experience 3+ years ago and I don’t think they are going anywhere super soon but they aren’t trying to cater to  instore sales anymore, just think of the displays in your store that haven’t been updated for years or don’t work, and how many people you have working at once.  I also think the clientele for bestbuy went downhill with Covid, but don’t blame the customers for corporate mistakes, and definitely don’t blame curbside pickup for loses in employees, it secures sales that may not exist otherwise and sales is where the money to pay employees comes from.

}","In the old days the ARA job was a good way to be able to mostly hide from customers and the job description reflected as such (not in so plain terms).

The new job descriptions for most store positions have been updated to reflect this new mindset. For example here are a few excerpts from the current  Job Description:  The Geek Squad Advanced Repair Agent identifies and offers technology related, solution-based recommendations to solve customer needs and ensure that no customer is left unserved.   They create and maintain a supportive environment for customers by asking the right questions, listening carefully, taking detailed notes and partnering with other team members.   They are passionate about technology and leverage their technical abilities to create positive customer interactions by solving a variety of software and hardware issues.

Every team member should feel empowered to deliver a world-class and unique experience based on what each customer needs.  Key Responsibilities - Helps drive a positive customer experience by building relationships, exhibiting empathy, and providing solutions for their needs.  I mean it should not be any surprise by now that stores are doing whatever is necessary to try to meet the customer expectations.   Do I agree?  Of course not!  I think the forecasters and labor teams have severely miscalculated the post-covid retail landscape, and lost sight of what made Best Buy great. That formula was simple, train great employees, promot a genuine customer experience and REAL having fun while being the best. That best buy is still there, just being suffocated.  Take my word with a grain of salt, because I've been out of the store since April, but until then I had high enough visibility to see all of this coming and most of my predictions have come to pass up until then.

}","Just so it's clear; Corie Barry, and by extension the executive board, has stated PUBLICLY that the ultimate goal of the company is to reduce ALL of its employees and storefronts. Her ""vision"" is for a single worker in a store manning a pick up counter, period, with no thought to logistics, services, customer experience and certainly not employees. She WILL eventually cut EVERY full time worker- management, sales, warehouse, distribution and everything else. The endgame appears to be reduce Best Buy to being an IP that will be sold to Amazon and Amazon will take over the actual operational costs while it gains a  retail showroom. So for any of you who thought that timeline was somewhere far off in the future, take a HARD look at a week ago, the second massive layoff in two years.  She is intentionally crippling the stores so that she can justify closing them when sales inevitably fall after lack of service drives customers completely out of brick and mortar. Her ""facts"" used to justify doing this are a set of self-fulfilling dictums which falsely inflate online sales figures while minimizing brick and mortar contributions, and she's either too greedy or too stupid to see that either she is being fed bad information or more likely, she is the source of that misinformation.  Right now, cutting staff can produce short term gains, but it is at the cost of long-term stability and sustainability and she knows that. When the stock value inevitably starts tanking hard and doesn't stop, the short term losses it causes will be assets, as she and the board can buy back even more shares of the company and when the sale to Amazon goes through, those shares will become worth billions. You aren't allowed to read about this on the ""other"" sub because the mods there are in bed with corporate and even though almost ALL of this information is public, discussion of it is actively suppressed, so for anyone who is thinking of making a career out of Best Buy, think twice.",651,"Does this statement reflect sentiment about Best Buy?

I get to the bridge that I have to cross in order to get from one city to another, and my tire completely gives out on me.

Now I want to return it.” The guy who helped me, bless his heart, faked a phone call and was pretending to talk to a customer saying “yes, we can return parts. The money will be sent back to your card within 2-3 days. Yes, even opened parts.” Stuff like that. So she rips the receipt out of my hand, processed the return.

That bay is definitely failing, but let me be clear, that is *not* your fault. At all. That is 100% on the upper management of the company. You haven't been given the tools you need to even have a chance to truly succeed. If you do manage to pull that bay out of the mud, it will be completely your own doing, not because of the company.  My advice is, if you do manage to find success at Best Buy, leave the moment a good opportunity comes your way. Use that store to teach yourself new skills, and grow as an installer. Then, when you've started to really get a handle on things, jump ship. Best Buy will not hesitate to screw you over, if you are in the way, so don't stay out of a false sense of loyalty, like I did.

Literally the only advantage they have is existence: there’s no other big box national electronics retailer left for them to lose to. If they had competition they wouldn’t be pulling stunts like this because they’d understand the value of a trained sales and operations team and competent leadership instead of trying to reduce labor in a “Jack of all trades / master of none” model.   “One direction” is already proving to be a company wide failure. I know I hear so many complaints from people who call 888-BESTBUY and were told incorrect things, SOLD incorrect things, or given poor expectations for deliveries with install.

That’s not the problem I have with it, and I’ll never feel bad because someone else is doing better.

It should have been 4% + 1% per year of service up to five years, then an additional 0.5% per year of service up to five years, and finally an additional 0.25% per year of service beyond that (no limit). Someone with ten years would get 11.5%. Someone with fifteen years would get 12.75%. And so on.   And I still think sales associates should have some kind of commission pay. Would it be ideal? No. Would it cause there to be some infighting? Sure.

There are a lot of people who are going to talk bad about the company. Personally it’s been great for me.

}","Just be careful.  BBY is one of the *better* options in working retail, but the company still sucks. I worked there in 2016-17 started in PT sales and worked my way up to FT sales lead until my role was discontinued 1 week into the position. The benefits are just okay and discount pretty generous. However, they focus very hard on unrealistic sales goals, management can be very pushy, and they restructure/eliminate positions/headcount ALL THE TIME.  &#x200B;  More recently, I returned to BBY part time in warehouse (1 day a week, just barely working enough for the discount), but later left just before the holiday season because I did not want to work anymore hours and they were really pressuring me to work. It was a bit more relaxed for me the second time around, mainly because it was 4 hours a week and I did not really care. Warehouse is still very metric/numbers driven, but it's different because you don't have to deal with customers as much, and most of the goals are pretty obtainable depending on how organized your warehouse team is. Although, it's almost impossible to move up in warehouse as your strengths don't show as much as they would in sales/customer service.  &#x200B;  That being said, it can be very easy to move up if you have a positive attitude, play the game of being peppy in their cringe company culture, and obtain/exceed your sales goals. With the turnover, you could land yourself a supervisor position in just a few years. Just don't be discouraged when they restructure and eliminate it, I can guarantee you at some point it will happen.  If you've worked for Walmart, I'm sure BBY is the better option, just learn to play their game. I could be wrong, but I would peg BBY to be in a similar line as Target & Starbucks in regards to quality of the company, but this is just observations and I could be wrong.  &#x200B;  I've also heard Costco has decent benefits, but can't speak to the internal workings of the company and culture. I did work for Apple Retail and really enjoyed working there and was sad when I left to work at a 'real job'.  &#x200B;  WDD",33,"Does this statement reflect sentiment about Best Buy?

}",Purchasing pro is during open enrollment and it’s a max of 40hrs a year I do every year! Its not really purchasing pto u have to think of it as setting your pay aside for when u decide to take a week off and still get paid. The cost of your pto days is based on your yearly salary. So however much you get paid per week is how much your 40 hours of pto will cost you. The benefit is that you can use them the first week in January if u want to even though they haven’t been paid for yet because they take it out a little each pay check.
