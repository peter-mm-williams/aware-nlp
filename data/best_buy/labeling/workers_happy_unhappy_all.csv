}","all day doing other things.  They are turning more stores into just warehouses, the staff is trained to hand the customer off to a sales consultant or sr sales consultant. So it makes the worker feel less important. A lot of people are taking pay cuts to leave. In my store alone I can name 6 off the top of my head and more looking for other work. ALL of which where the best employees in the store.   My store went from 7 to 2 designers. One of which was a “straight” man who asked me to have sex with his wife while he watched. Turns out he’s also both gay and straight. He’s had multiple sexual harassment accusations. Our store had a new GM take our store over and right before the switch. This GM had known the gay cuck for “years” Turns out he’s doing the interviews. Again, I was one of the top networking designers in the country, but he sold more TVs and sound-bars than me. I made the company more money, he sold more entry level product.   They promoted the gay cuck  Try to get me to hand my clients over to him.  My clients were CEOs, Lawyers, Real-estate investors. They were loyal to me. Repeat clients   His customer was a kid who’s parents own a small phone repair store that bought brackets and entry level TVs from him.   Best Buy is a who you know - blunt force object that pushed all their skilled workers out because they think they don’t need them. The majority of their money comes from online purchases.

Then Best Buy is the job for you, because you'll never have time for those things, and they don't care! They own you, and they'll make sure you know it.   Want time off? Good luck! Especially around the holidays. They lose so many employees and are constantly understaffed because of the horrible way they treat people. But guess what? Because you stick around its your job to make up for their inadequacy! So don't you dare ask for time off. But watch the GM's come and go as they please, working ""half days"" or pretending they showed up at 6am to leave at 2pm on a Saturday, or scheduling full weeks ""working from home"".   Customers get to treat you like shit. They yell and cuss at you and Best Buy will just allow it. Better thicken up that skin before your shift.   Want a regular schedule so you can plan your life? HA! Your schedule will NEVER be the same week to week (except to know you work at least 6 days a week). If you are lucky enough to get 2 days off, they're split. And your shifts will look something like; 10am-8pm, 11am- 10pm. I'd love someone to genuinely explain how you have a life with those kinds of shifts 6 days a week. You will never have a weekend day off ever again.   Bottom line, Best Buy exhibits behavior that their employees are expendable and replaceable. Its clear they no longer see a value in people at all. Probably because they realized during 2020 they could make more money moving their platform online.

We then moved to another location, the company revamped numerous times and the sole purpose was to shill credit cards.  Managers lied to customers and then brought the customers to us only to have the customer pissed at us because the managers were dumb.  I was a VPL in home theater but was told I had to sell everything and work in other departments. I then moved to mobile as the att vpl and ended up having to work in every department when managers didn’t do anything, they “weren’t allowed” to help customers, but instead had the queue system which barely worked. We were told in mobile that we were replaceable, but nobody other than the vpls and a few select other people know how to activate phones and service them. The managers tried and failed at phone activations and left the pissed off customers for the vpl to deal with.

}","Well, I worked there for 4 years. 3 of being in the highest ranked sales position in the company (MDC/System Designer) my reasons were pretty well the same grievances company wide. My reasons were compounded by favoritism and sexual harassment. Note** MDC was 100% commission based. You could make ALOT of money if you’re a closer (I am, was one of the top network designers in the country)  Best Buy recently made the largest restructuring they’ve had in over a decade. This roll out was through the pandemic and VERY ROUGH.   They went from hourly, specialized departments to hourly+commission store wide sales consultants. Meaning the sales people had to step out of their “comfort zone” and learn other parts of the store they were not familiar with. This new business model included in-home “Sr. Sales Consultants” that would advise customers in their homes. On paper and in theory this is a smart move. A personal touch higher paid sales people that are more knowledgeable.   The problem with that is there are only a few guys skilled enough to do these roles and worked mainly on the MDC department along with a handful of Best Buy “In home advisors” which were just more entry-level system designers. When they rolled everything out they stripped the majority system designers of their titles, made them focus on lesser products and learn the entire store. And high end or high level jobs would go to the 1 or 2 designers that would then take on everyone’s workload.   It was stressful as hell It was demoralizing being stripped of a prestigious title. It made us feel like a number in a machine  I personally was offered a pay cut and they tried to make me feel excited about it. (Most got raises, more on that later.) THEN MADE ME WORK MORE! The rest of the store basically got pay raises and demoted. It’s what it felt like. Payed more to eat more shit.  They stopped caring about the things that made the work place fun and focused heavily on subscription based services (TTS) and coached primarily on that. And getting credit cards. The important managers (GM/SSM) are rarely in the store to address concerns and the company has them hide behind a computer all day doing other things.  They are turning more stores into just warehouses, the staff is trained to hand the customer off to a sales consultant or sr sales consultant. So it makes the worker feel less important. A lot of people are taking pay cuts",1081,"Does this statement reflect sentiment about Best Buy? Label the sentiment as positive (1), negative (-1), or neutral/irrelevant (0)."

}","Funny stories (current and ex-employees) about of Best Buy miss?; I worked at BB as a Computer Sales Associate for 9 years in the 2010s and left at the end of 2020.  I remember how shitty the company was before Hubert Joly and thoroughly enjoyed all of the things Hubert did to improve all of the stores, including but not limited to cutting executive staff before loval leadership.  Stores back then had a family/friend atmosphere. Our store was the Wild West. We hooked up an iPod to the store’s speakers and would play music throughout the day and whoever got a Best Buy card, that associate could change the music station. (Pro tip: turning on Christmas music in July caused employees and customers to riot and complain to me to change it hahah)  Two employees got into a ball tag war where they’d randomly try and hit each other in the nuts while working. It spread like wildfire throughout the store.   An employee poached someone else’s sale that they had been working on for almost two hours that was $2k+. The employee who lost the sale walked by the poaching employee with a Game of Thrones box set and swung the box set up into the employee’s ball sack and caused the employee to drop to the ground. The employee took over and got his original sale back while the customer was dying of laughter.  It all ended when an employee was hit in the balls with a pair of airpods while carrying a 30 lb printer down the ladder and fell off and broke the printer haha. HR came in and inquired with everyone and everyone protected each other and didnt say anything, but the GM, who was a G, admitted it happened and laid on the grenade for all of us and got probation. We took him out and bought him some beers afterwards.  When the Force Awakens came out, there was a huge snow storm that effectively kept us from going  home so we all walked to the local movie theater where they gave us a special, free showing of Star WRs until the roads were plowed and salted.  We hooked up our phones to the bluetooth speaker demo products and would wait for the manager to walk through the department and contact customers in that section and then turn on a fart app and have the speaker loudly fart next to the manager haha.

}","Then there was the gaming initiative in 2011 where I was so optimistic that things were turning around.    At this point I was trying to raise a family and thought this would actually be my career. But then we didn’t receive enough labor for our team full-time or had to work 32 1/2 hours supervisor 37 minimum.  We had two part-timers that got about 12 hours each.  Best Buy was talking about how bad shrink was and gaming, just like it always has been, and just like it always will be, but we did not have the labor to be staffed during each open hour.  Not to mention any labor for truck, adset, etc.  Then my position was removed August 2012.  The writing was on the wall.  I could either take severance or any of the available full-time positions that would exist.  Problem is there are three stores in our area, not counting the Best Buy mobiles.  So it was a dog pile of people for one or two positions that paid less than what we made five years ago at that point.    I took the severance, eight years of professional workmanship gone.  but a lot of my former friends and colleagues were still stuck on the Best Buy train wreck.  I joined this sub Reddit just to see how things have been going but it’s not very optimistic. Most of my bad dreams have been of regular work at Best Buy.  Now, almost everyone I know is out of Best Buy and has long since moved on. Years ago, Best Buy got rid of 401(k), matching I remember reading. Which is the most petty way of saying we don’t care about our employees and we are pretending that this is a cost savings measure.  The few old coworkers that remained said that they are sharing a manager between multiple stores. Almost nobody is full-time. They have like two supervisors. Which means some key holders are literally part time, so have no stake in the company.  All risk no reward.  Pay is capped at comical levels.  I just needed to get all that off my chest.

}","Let Go Today; I was informed today that I was being terminated due to attendance violations. (Being late, not calling out or no call no showing). It’s been quite the experience over the last 20 months. The people I’ve worked with, especially in product flow are some of the funniest, most hard-working people I’ve ever known, and I was honored and privileged to work alongside them.   With that being said, Best Buy, as a corporation, is completely and utterly fucked. Starting at the top, Cori Berri is one of the worst executives I’ve ever heard of. She constantly takes this company and drives it into the ground. It almost seems intentional at this point. She is a fucking idiot and I wouldn’t trust her to run a lemonade stand, let alone a huge corporation.   To one of my managers in particular, you are an asshole. Plain and simple. You constantly call people out over the walkie for stupid things, knowing damn well that it could’ve been a 1on1 conversation, or one that didn’t need to occur in the first place. Instead, you sit on your ass or stand at the AP and belittle people. Idgaf how long you’ve worked there, you’re a dick and I hope you eat shit. You constantly bring morale down throughout the store and then wonder why people don’t have good attitudes.  To the managers, STOP INTERRUPTING CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN SALES FLOOR AND CUSTOMERS. It has to be the most deflating thing in the world when you’re having a good conversation with a customer, selling them product, learning about them and their interests, and then hearing over the walkie, “oo (salesperson’s name), looks like a good membership opportunity”. I hear that and I can feel the balloon being deflated. Fuck your stupid memberships, fuck your stupid credit cards, 99% of customers don’t want it and you make the interactions worse by shoving it down their throats.   With that, Best Buy needs to bring back specialization. One of the biggest complaints that customers have is that “your sales floor doesn’t know shit about the product.” Well, how could they? Best Buy wants sales floor to be experts on thousands of products. You know what happens when you try to be an expert on everything? You’re an expert on nothing. It’s simply impossible.

}","Left Best Buy After Six Years; Some Tips and Advice for those Employed.; 1. Work hard, but not too hard. If you’re trying to get promoted within your store then personal performance matters, but it doesn’t in the eyes of corporate. Being likeable by others is often more important than your numbers when it comes to promotions.  2. Your experience in retail will vastly be determined by the managers at the store. If you don’t like your management, look for another store in the area and switch over. The extra 10 minute drive is worth not hating your life every single day you clock in.  3. There is no job security in retail. The position you’re working now will most likely not exist in another year or two. If you can’t constantly adapt to new roles, stores, and responsibilities, then retail isn’t for you. (This isn’t exclusive to BBY)  4. Don’t be afraid to apply for positions you don’t feel qualified for. I got a work-from-home corporate position after being in retail for a long time with no degree; again, you need to be likeable by others.  5. Steer clear of post-military employees, specifically those in management roles. They take their jobs way too fucking seriously and you don’t get paid enough for that bullshit. This isn’t the Marines, it’s Best Buy for Christ’s sake.  6. Stand up for yourself. I see too many people get walked over by others at this job.  7. Don’t fuck with the installers; be nice to them. Leave notes on your orders. The installers are your best friends if you take care of them, I’ve had many go back to job sites and clean up some of my mistakes on orders. They’ll save you from many angry customers.  8. Don’t fuck with the Geek Squad employees either. See above point for reference.   9. HR doesn’t mess around. In 99% of cases it’s so much easier for them to fire someone. If you actually use the HR hotline as you should, you will see someone lose their job (provided you have a valid case).  10. You may see your position as a career, but corporate does not. The reality is that 99% of retail positions have high turnover rates, and corporate treats them this way.  11. The current sales model is extremely broken and a far cry from what it used to be at Best",4848,"Does this statement reflect sentiment about Best Buy?

The leaders at Best Buy don’t really lead. They see the title and just bark orders or come over to “help”. Most don’t deescalate issues with customers and they don’t know how or they seemingly don’t escalate order issues. They never tell new hires or advisors information about the store or company until it’s last minute and by then it’s too late. They will also tell new hires the wrong information. Our new Assistant GM told a new hire we don’t use SKUs for our Apple products when product flow and all advisers on the floor do use SKUs when looking for Apple products.

}","Rant Time!; Rant time!  I work in mobile and my store gets so busy throughout the day, most days, and we are so understaffed due to corporate not only extending our operating hours, but also taking away around 8 hours of labor from our department, that I am working back to back with customers that have been waiting in the queue for 20+ minutes.   What this leads to is most mobile associates not being able to take our California government required 10min rest breaks.   I’m not sure about other states, but in California we are apparently supposed to get paid an extra hour of labor at our regular rate for each break we are not given and even though nobody at Best Buy explicitly says “no you can’t take a break”, it is  heavily implied that we shouldn’t (especially when we are super busy).   Best Buy reports record profits but keeps cutting labor which puts the pressure even more on us because we have to keep picking up the slack for missing coworkers, which is also leading to an ever decreasing moral and mental health of employees, leading to more call outs and even more missing labor.   Best Buy corporate needs to either start hiring more people or implement break tracking with TLC to make sure employees are getting properly compensated for missing breaks. While employees own a certain amount of responsibility to make sure they take their breaks, the company owns even more of that responsibility as they don’t schedule enough people in specialized departments like mobile, who can cover for breaks.   So assuming you’ve been working full time for Best Buy for a few years and how many breaks you have been forced to skip due to low coverage. 40 breaks? 100 breaks? So many you don’t even know what a break is anymore?  If the company minimum wage is $15/hr, how much money has Best Buy stolen from you? One hundred breaks at minimum wage is $1500, granted a decent chunk of that is taxed and I don’t know about you, but shoot I sure could use the rest for bills.

That would be your fifth reason for the dip in applicants.   I also found this quote hilarious: ""*it's about a wholesome set of benefits that we can put in place*""  Really? What benefits do PT workers get? No medical/dental/vision, no PTO to speak of (but routinely near full-time hours). I guess they can buy BBY stock at a discount in the ESPP program? Wheeeeee.   And when you say ""and flexibility that we can put in place"" it rings more like you want to cut people from 39 hours to 4 hours with little notice, but also want them to come in on their scheduled days off on short notice too. How does this benefit the customer Corie? What is your endgame here?

If you are bored enough to read my stupid life story:  I was part of the grand opening team for a Best Buy in 2006.  35,000 ft.² I was full-time media, basically a senior, but without the actual position or pay.  We had six managers, 12 supervisors, many seniors, and full timers.  I went through the reorg in 2009 and barely kept my position. Supervisors drop to five, managers drop to four.  My stress gave me ulcers.  Our goals got to unrealistic math levels.  In gaming we had to have 8% service plans, accessories 12.5%, 3% geek squad set up services for consoles ($30 to turn the system on and run updates lol).  I had done the math at the time and management was unpleasant with me when I said this was not possible. Nintendo Wii accessory sales when we had no wii remotes 70 nunchucks.  Assuming we literally sold geek squad, black tie protection on each possible device we would not hit our numbers.  And that’s assuming that customers come in and literally buy everything we tell them to.    Speaking of more unrealistic, I was told on a Monday morning to replace all of the price tag’s in gaming, because the wordage for performance replacement, plan (PRP) was rebranded to geek squad black-tie protection replacement plan (GSBTPRP).  I remember telling them that it wasn’t going to happen today and they got upset.

Telzon taking about 10sec per tag in our shitty faraday cage of a store.  Takes about 10 sec to remove old tag and put on new tag.  35 hours of labor assuming the tag printer doesn’t jam, zero customers need help, etc.  and all of this was less than 24 hours after an adset, so basically we had to redo adset is what corporate wanted.  management hated me.

}","Lack of retention; So I’ve been working for Best Buy for a couple months now. I don’t mean to sound like a showboat, but this will help my overall point: I was the top salesman last month and am on track to do even better numbers this month, all in my first three months.  Im an occasional/seasonal employee, and yet my employer is giving me full time hours. Im hitting overtime this week and next week, and by no means am I complaining. But something I’ve noticed is that they’re cutting hours on employees that have been here for years. A full time employee is receiving 25-30 hours to cut labor hours and im receiving 38+ each week.  While I understand that this is a “performance based position,” my colleagues have seemingly bashed me for undermining their hours when all im doing is my job. In my first three months, I’ve seen full timers leave because of labor cuts, not just on the sales floor, but product flow just as much.  Best Buy really needs to work on incentivizing with their employees better.  At this rate, I’d have much better pay at an actual commission based job and probably be appreciated more.

It doesn’t cost jobs to reduce the time customers spend in store, it’s costs job for them to stop making the in store experience any good.   People didn’t stop going into bestbuy because curbside became and option, prior to curbside there was store pickup customers, who notoriously didn’t spend money in store anyways, so they just added to the queue in store and took in store resources at customer service, moving a portion of that to curbside which doesn’t need someone trained in customer services and returns (CS staff means that the store can borrow from warehouse or other non-customer roles).  The biggest loss of jobs was removing decent training for the Sales rolls, reducing staff in record profit years, and choosing profit over staffing. BestBuy was a much better shopping experience 3+ years ago and I don’t think they are going anywhere super soon but they aren’t trying to cater to  instore sales anymore, just think of the displays in your store that haven’t been updated for years or don’t work, and how many people you have working at once.  I also think the clientele for bestbuy went downhill with Covid, but don’t blame the customers for corporate mistakes, and definitely don’t blame curbside pickup for loses in employees, it secures sales that may not exist otherwise and sales is where the money to pay employees comes from.

}","In the old days the ARA job was a good way to be able to mostly hide from customers and the job description reflected as such (not in so plain terms).

The new job descriptions for most store positions have been updated to reflect this new mindset. For example here are a few excerpts from the current  Job Description:  The Geek Squad Advanced Repair Agent identifies and offers technology related, solution-based recommendations to solve customer needs and ensure that no customer is left unserved.   They create and maintain a supportive environment for customers by asking the right questions, listening carefully, taking detailed notes and partnering with other team members.   They are passionate about technology and leverage their technical abilities to create positive customer interactions by solving a variety of software and hardware issues.

Every team member should feel empowered to deliver a world-class and unique experience based on what each customer needs.  Key Responsibilities - Helps drive a positive customer experience by building relationships, exhibiting empathy, and providing solutions for their needs.  I mean it should not be any surprise by now that stores are doing whatever is necessary to try to meet the customer expectations.   Do I agree?  Of course not!  I think the forecasters and labor teams have severely miscalculated the post-covid retail landscape, and lost sight of what made Best Buy great. That formula was simple, train great employees, promot a genuine customer experience and REAL having fun while being the best. That best buy is still there, just being suffocated.  Take my word with a grain of salt, because I've been out of the store since April, but until then I had high enough visibility to see all of this coming and most of my predictions have come to pass up until then.

}","Just so it's clear; Corie Barry, and by extension the executive board, has stated PUBLICLY that the ultimate goal of the company is to reduce ALL of its employees and storefronts. Her ""vision"" is for a single worker in a store manning a pick up counter, period, with no thought to logistics, services, customer experience and certainly not employees. She WILL eventually cut EVERY full time worker- management, sales, warehouse, distribution and everything else. The endgame appears to be reduce Best Buy to being an IP that will be sold to Amazon and Amazon will take over the actual operational costs while it gains a  retail showroom. So for any of you who thought that timeline was somewhere far off in the future, take a HARD look at a week ago, the second massive layoff in two years.  She is intentionally crippling the stores so that she can justify closing them when sales inevitably fall after lack of service drives customers completely out of brick and mortar. Her ""facts"" used to justify doing this are a set of self-fulfilling dictums which falsely inflate online sales figures while minimizing brick and mortar contributions, and she's either too greedy or too stupid to see that either she is being fed bad information or more likely, she is the source of that misinformation.  Right now, cutting staff can produce short term gains, but it is at the cost of long-term stability and sustainability and she knows that. When the stock value inevitably starts tanking hard and doesn't stop, the short term losses it causes will be assets, as she and the board can buy back even more shares of the company and when the sale to Amazon goes through, those shares will become worth billions. You aren't allowed to read about this on the ""other"" sub because the mods there are in bed with corporate and even though almost ALL of this information is public, discussion of it is actively suppressed, so for anyone who is thinking of making a career out of Best Buy, think twice.",651,"Does this statement reflect sentiment about Best Buy?

I get to the bridge that I have to cross in order to get from one city to another, and my tire completely gives out on me.

Now I want to return it.” The guy who helped me, bless his heart, faked a phone call and was pretending to talk to a customer saying “yes, we can return parts. The money will be sent back to your card within 2-3 days. Yes, even opened parts.” Stuff like that. So she rips the receipt out of my hand, processed the return.

That bay is definitely failing, but let me be clear, that is *not* your fault. At all. That is 100% on the upper management of the company. You haven't been given the tools you need to even have a chance to truly succeed. If you do manage to pull that bay out of the mud, it will be completely your own doing, not because of the company.  My advice is, if you do manage to find success at Best Buy, leave the moment a good opportunity comes your way. Use that store to teach yourself new skills, and grow as an installer. Then, when you've started to really get a handle on things, jump ship. Best Buy will not hesitate to screw you over, if you are in the way, so don't stay out of a false sense of loyalty, like I did.

Literally the only advantage they have is existence: there’s no other big box national electronics retailer left for them to lose to. If they had competition they wouldn’t be pulling stunts like this because they’d understand the value of a trained sales and operations team and competent leadership instead of trying to reduce labor in a “Jack of all trades / master of none” model.   “One direction” is already proving to be a company wide failure. I know I hear so many complaints from people who call 888-BESTBUY and were told incorrect things, SOLD incorrect things, or given poor expectations for deliveries with install.

That’s not the problem I have with it, and I’ll never feel bad because someone else is doing better.

It should have been 4% + 1% per year of service up to five years, then an additional 0.5% per year of service up to five years, and finally an additional 0.25% per year of service beyond that (no limit). Someone with ten years would get 11.5%. Someone with fifteen years would get 12.75%. And so on.   And I still think sales associates should have some kind of commission pay. Would it be ideal? No. Would it cause there to be some infighting? Sure.

There are a lot of people who are going to talk bad about the company. Personally it’s been great for me.

}","Just be careful.  BBY is one of the *better* options in working retail, but the company still sucks. I worked there in 2016-17 started in PT sales and worked my way up to FT sales lead until my role was discontinued 1 week into the position. The benefits are just okay and discount pretty generous. However, they focus very hard on unrealistic sales goals, management can be very pushy, and they restructure/eliminate positions/headcount ALL THE TIME.  &#x200B;  More recently, I returned to BBY part time in warehouse (1 day a week, just barely working enough for the discount), but later left just before the holiday season because I did not want to work anymore hours and they were really pressuring me to work. It was a bit more relaxed for me the second time around, mainly because it was 4 hours a week and I did not really care. Warehouse is still very metric/numbers driven, but it's different because you don't have to deal with customers as much, and most of the goals are pretty obtainable depending on how organized your warehouse team is. Although, it's almost impossible to move up in warehouse as your strengths don't show as much as they would in sales/customer service.  &#x200B;  That being said, it can be very easy to move up if you have a positive attitude, play the game of being peppy in their cringe company culture, and obtain/exceed your sales goals. With the turnover, you could land yourself a supervisor position in just a few years. Just don't be discouraged when they restructure and eliminate it, I can guarantee you at some point it will happen.  If you've worked for Walmart, I'm sure BBY is the better option, just learn to play their game. I could be wrong, but I would peg BBY to be in a similar line as Target & Starbucks in regards to quality of the company, but this is just observations and I could be wrong.  &#x200B;  I've also heard Costco has decent benefits, but can't speak to the internal workings of the company and culture. I did work for Apple Retail and really enjoyed working there and was sad when I left to work at a 'real job'.  &#x200B;  WDD",33,"Does this statement reflect sentiment about Best Buy?

}",Purchasing pro is during open enrollment and it’s a max of 40hrs a year I do every year! Its not really purchasing pto u have to think of it as setting your pay aside for when u decide to take a week off and still get paid. The cost of your pto days is based on your yearly salary. So however much you get paid per week is how much your 40 hours of pto will cost you. The benefit is that you can use them the first week in January if u want to even though they haven’t been paid for yet because they take it out a little each pay check.

}","Thank you for the response. But chicken guy is popular. I swear I recognized the chickens.   But, in browsing, around, I found a wonderful excell file with lots of names and contacts of 3pl and a good amount of their structure. At least from the view from bestbuy. It's an old by about a year and a half, but yea.   I believe you in that you get the right email to the right person, you can get accountability.  The problem is the availability and knowledge to execute that path towards correcting 3P.  The lack of readily available info, seems very purposeful (which it likely is)  With how easy it is to find store information, then leadership information, etc of bestbuy grown employees, it really should be equally accessible for getting information and coaching to 3pl to fix issues.   Also,I'm looking for numbers. Bestbuy employee customer care is dwindling in favor of 3PL. I'm very curious what metrics leadership is using to justify this move.   If I had to guess. They are looking at heavily at call length and transfer and not much else. That's the only way 3pl can beat home grown CC. I know while I was in that world, when I got someone who had been ran through the call center transfer rodeo, I took as much time as needed to get the customer taken care of. Productivity on paper would be sacrificed, but a customer was taken care of.   If that gap in awareness or recognition that Home based BBCC are more likely to resolve the customers issues which usually means longer times on the phone with the customer, then that's a problem. And, imo, that's what the trend leads me to believe is happening. Some pencil pusher is just seeing black and white data and making calls off of that, or they have a leader who's even more disconnected from the actual problem making quick judgment calls.   I'm seeing that level of leadership through ignorance from market level to store level, so it isn't much of a stretch to believe that's also what is driving decisions concerning home based CC reps and 3pl ones.",3199,"Does this statement reflect sentiment about Best Buy?

When they ask me specific questions about the product I try to resonate with them and if I honestly don’t know the answer I will look it up or try to pull up the features tab on the app under the product information to see if anything in there will answer their question. It can be a pain because the customer has to wait for me to answer but usually they appreciate the effort and if they get upset I usually just be like “I’m sorry I am not super familiar with this product but I can pair you up with someone who would know more about it if you up to wait until they are available to help you” so it doesn’t sound like I’m completely helpless.",4130,"Does this statement reflect sentiment about Best Buy?

They are probably the least bright OLED right now. But I'd say they are suitable for any room where blinds can be drawn. Ideal for darker spaces.  Sony prioritized accuracy of intent more in their image processing resulting in a sometimes less saturated and cool image than their competition, especially in a more vivid picture mode. You do still get reflections though, being able to see light fixtures and stuff . But you can't get rid of that without a matte display.  And that would suck for the contrast. Some of the competition is brighter or has better anti glare. But Sony is pretty good in both departments and is awesome in its own regard.

,,,"I am a PC DA so this is going to be from a Geek Squad perspective, and it’s easier for me to sell because it’s usually cheaper to sell it than what the price of the job would be without TT, but I typically take the “not a salesy salesperson” approach because I don’t enjoy pushy salespeople.  In store, you could do this by explaining that TT includes discounts and since it covers services and labor on what they are purchasing, a new PC setup & migration in-store or in-home would be cheaper with TT, plus it includes a better warranty on most devices.   “Would you like me to have one of our Geek Squad agents come set up your new computer? They can transfer the data and make sure everything is working. If you have any questions a few weeks after using it, they can come back out. Typically appointments are $130+ per visit, but with TT, it would just be $200 for the entire year.” If they start to roll their eyes, I usually feel weird because sales feels gross, so I say, “I know, I have to mention it because it’s a really good deal,” and then I will just move right along. Maybe mention it again a little later, “so you’re going to set this up and transfer your data yourself, right?” *As I type this, I am realizing I am a manipulative little shit and maybe I do like sales hmm…*  Do you know any of the Geek Squad agents in your precinct?

Probably unlikely that you will be able to sell $200 memberships on a little accessory like that very often, but I think it helps to talk about it with everyone. Some people are rich and dumb as hell. I say that with love.   If they are buying one thing and mention their slow internet, an agent can come out, set up the product and check the internet speeds/equipment while they are there (just make sure to book the appointment with enough time).  The warranty that is included with TT is pretty baller too + vague in-store discounts lol.  I know selling things kind of sucks and can feel weird and degrading, but you don’t have to be a sleazy car salesman to offer a year’s worth of support.

,,,"I am in agreement!  It is very telling how badly workers have been groomed to default to freaking out and attacking one another on topics like this.  The folks that start calling for fellow humans to just ""work or leave"" have been lost to us and go out of their way to viciously defend corp and store leadership.  If they put that same energy into standing in solidarity with their fellow workers, we wouldn't even need a walkout of any kind.  Because if we did stand together we could actually be at the table.    I have had some very good times and met lots of friends and other cool people at BBY.  It has had times where they showed attempts at good-faith employee relations.  Also the point of said walkout is about those of us that actually care about making the company better.  The bootlickers yell ""don't like it, then leave!"" shit as if just finding a new job is like buying candy, and like we shouldn't be treated like humans.  Doing something like a walkout or forming a union is all what happens when the ""correct"" channels are taken but ignored.  They do so much that just counteracts everything we are constantly told.  We are the ones that have to deal with any and all customer/client rage and confusion that comes from badly setup ideas changing in ways that go against how large chunks of said shoppers/clients expect things.  Corp will just keep bad ideas going even if it is painfully obvious that it isn't working.  The folks that seem to make the plans are all super disconnected from the real world and real people (and I imagine they just want to speed up the latter fast enough to not be the one to deal with blow back).  If the stuff isn't working based on back and white metrics, it is us that are surely the issue and not their ""amazing idea"".    The current setup is based on trying to make more and more money than the record breaking years of 2020 and 2021 isn't sustainable.  Those years shouldn't be used in the same way that normal years are.  Sales went nuts because all of a sudden so many people had to quickly get or upgrade stuff to simply keep working and/or going to school.  Much like how so many streaming services are seeing big drops in subs.  Of course more people will sign up for streaming media when they can't go places like they normally would.

,,,"seeing big drops in subs.  Of course more people will sign up for streaming media when they can't go places like they normally would.  Which also means that projections for those services shouldn't keep planning for those numbers to keep growing instead of dropping.  So we see budgets slashed, things canceled, and lots and lots of workers laid off in desperate efforts to make the numbers look like things are still booming from a shareholders standpoint.  Which can only work for so long (especially if top people keep giving themselves higher and higher bonuses) before everything just falls apart dramatically.   If we didn't care, then obviously we would just leave.  We need things to be done in ways that work for both workers and the top.  If they are going to keep forcing us to watch lame elearnings about ""mental health importance"" and ""really caring about respecting each other"".  Then they could also start doing stuff that materially impacts workers lives in positive ways.  The ""customer obsession and building relationships"" nonsense is completely undermined by running everything so super lean in all departments.  Leaders freak the hell out if even two people are in a line, and just drag others that are already helping in some way into it.  But they could've allowed more people to be helped by getting in there and doing it themselves.  All that running around to find someone is time they could've just did it.  I hope that the stores that were the starting point of this walkout go through with it and in big numbers (I may if it happens in my area).  They can fire us all, but at a certain point it bites them hard if they were to do so.  All the extra and useless stuff needed to train new people has gotten so bad in some departments that it couldn't be done fast enough.    We just want respect and not constant gaslighting with threats that go along with it.  We want to not be doing all the jobs at the same time (especially when it is stuff that is outside our capacity).  The company used to have people that knew shit about their departments and could really answer questions or give advice to customers/clients.  Now in the moment Google and pray for real and not scam shit is normal.  We could fix so much of the new inefficiencies by having real scheduling and staffing.

,,,"It's against the law to prevent you from talking about pay. The very fact that you feel awkward about doing this is a prime reason WHY there's a law that protects doing so. Like others have said, you do have to be careful about whom you share pay information with and large companies have enough impossible-to-follow regulations that terminating you for talking about pay can be legally excused as something else, but until the culture of silence changes and workers organize and stand up for themselves, it will only get worse and cold-blooded executives like Corie Barry will reap huge personal fortunes while grinding both employees and the company itself into nothing.      It sounds like your ""friend"" is a lazy person who demands special treatment already and your management most likely sees her work assignment as fitting compensation for her job performance, no matter how much longer she's been there than you. She can't do anything to you officially, but you may want to distance yourself from her as she may allow her frustration to motivate her to file false things about you, and if I read you correctly, she's already threatening you for making more.

,,,"Managers not letting me quit??; So I've been dealing with a really weird situation recently. For background, I'm a college student in my late 20's. Been working in retail for nearly a decade. I didn't finish my bachelor's when I was younger, but I went back to school last year to finish my degree so I don't have to work retail for the rest of my life. I am in a fortunate position with scholarships and financial aid that I don't necessarily need to work while I'm in school, but I thought I'd stick with Best Buy for a little extra cash and for the employee discount.  &#x200B;  When my current semester started a couple of weeks ago I quickly realized that my homework and assigned readings are going to be far more time-consuming than previous semesters. So a week and a half ago I informed my GM that I was giving my two weeks notice so I could focus exclusively on my studies. He basically disregarded me and said I'd have to speak with my immediate supervisor, who was on vacation at the time. The following week I had to call off on truck night because I had too much homework, and my ASM manager calls me saying I need to manage my time better and that they'll just schedule me for less shifts or on different days. And like the GM, he just ignored that fact that I said I'm quitting and continued to schedule me.  &#x200B;  Then when I was working this weekend, my ASM again tried to talk to me about my schedule in a very manipulative way, ignoring me when I say I'm quitting and continuing to talk about just working less hours or staying on as occasional/seasonal. I finally had to assert myself and clearly confirm that I am quitting. Then I ask to confirm that my last shift will be in the coming week, and my ASM says, ""No, you just gave your two-week notice, so you will have to work two more weeks,"" completely ignoring the fact that I had already given my two-week notice to the GM more than a week previous. On this same shift I'm dealing with the usual understaffing that my store and every other store has been dealing with. For the final two-thirds of my 9.5-hour shift I was the only product flow employee in the store. I was so stressed out during that shift that I was seriously considering walking",571,"Does this statement reflect sentiment about Best Buy?

At that point IF you ever want to be considered for possible employment in the future I’d call HR and file a complaint.

However, retail locations and most other businesses are not public areas. It is private property that you are allowed to come purchase items from during certain times of the day. Actual public areas fall along the lines of sidewalks, streets, parks, etc. They are usually locations owned by the city/state and paid for by taxpayers (the general public). Business buildings, even their parking lots, are owned by landlords or the business themselves not the general public.  Either way, in almost all circumstances, you should always ask permission to film.

,,,"Hi!  So the answer you're looking for is yes, as long as it follows the Best Buy ""Qualified Gift"" rules (available through HR) you should be fine. I don't know all the specifics however the main ones that I remember are:  * You have to be making a gift purchase to be given to an individual for individual use, or to a qualified non-profit organization * Cannot purchase items for use in for profit business, or to be intended for resale using employee discount  * Employee cannot be reimbursed by the person/organization you're giving the gift to * Additionally, it is my understanding that employees may purchase GSP/ Protection and services/ installations as qualified gifts as well.  If you purchase through dotcom make sure the shipping/ delivery address is for that person, not your address * I personally recommended that the services/ GSP be setup in the name of the person / organization you're giving the gift to * Also recommend that you put the gift purchase on it's own sale/purchase and don't combine with other personal purchases * Strongly recommend you provide the giftee with a gift receipt, if not a copy of the actual receipt for their records, and in case anything happens where they have to warranty claim on it. *  If you're shipping to a different store for pickup, make sure you list the person picking up the product's actual first and last name as it says on their state issued ID, and tell them to bring state issued ID with them to pickup.  Finally, be aware that employee purchases, including qualified gifts, are tracked and can be scrutinized by internal audit / asset protection teams and discounted goods/ services/ etc. may also count as taxable non-wage income on your W-2. If you have specific questions, don't take my word for it--follow up with a inquiry to HR about the qualified gift policy to make sure you're making the right choices and following the procedures correctly.   TLDR: Yes you can use employee discount for QUALIFIED GIFTS. There is a policy. Follow up with HR for specific details on what you can and can't do.  Good luck!",636,"Does this statement reflect sentiment about Best Buy? Label the sentiment as positive (1), negative (-1), or neutral/irrelevant (0)."

We bought 4 LG appliances to get the 10% off instant rebate, but ended up having to do 2 separate transactions online because the fridge would show as out of stock unless it was the only thing being purchased. This messed up the instant 10% rebate.   I talked to a lot of people at customer service (online and on the phone) about it and finally someone understood. He talked to his supervisor and was able to get approval to issue me $900 in gift cards instead of a refund. Okay, cool, no biggie. He said it would be split into 2 because of the high dollar amount.  Again, cool.  After 2 hours on the phone, he assured me we were good to go and gave me a reference number “just in case.”   I called in today to ask if they could give me the gift card number over the phone so I could make on online purchase before the physical cards arrive. After being transferred 4 times, I finally am talking to someone who says he can help. The previous people had mentioned they saw the cards were issued, but couldn’t see the codes due to the high dollar amount. The rep I’m talking to eventually tells me that that those gift cards weren’t actually issued and I wouldn’t be getting them. He said it was because one gift card had already been issued to me and they can only do one gift card per order. The gift card I had received was for like $150 because I had a hell of a time getting the contractors to come out and install the waterline for my fridge.

,,,The company is losing my $15K appliance purchase over this.  Check the other subreddit and you'll see a lot of pissed off customers many of which are returning items or buying elsewhere from now on.  When someone gets points and becomes an upper tier member like myself we expect certain things and one of them is not for the program we just qualified for a month or two back to go away with 6 weeks notice.  Who does that?  Oh wait. That's right it's the new CEO who's taking something that's working and killing it. Did they learn nothing from JC Penney and similar companies that pulled this stunt and now struggle to survive?    Most won't read the email and will be shocked when they find out and they'll complain by no longer doing business with BB.    There's to many options out there for a company to pull a stunt like this.     Let's not mention the email being vague and not informing their customers of all the details of all the things that they are losing.   I don't get these companies.   Oh well. I'm going back to buying local. I didn't save that much going to BB. I did it for the points and such.   The local place will love to see me walk back in.

,,,Current Elite Plus and for the moment Total Tech member - I find this move to be an ethical breach of contract.  The deal was we spent a certain level last year and get benefits this year.  Now Best Buy is reneging on the deal mid year.  At the very least this should have been an end of year move.  I’m sure they have lots of safe harbor “we have all the rights you have none” fine print items to prevent an actual breach of contract legal action but ethically speaking I think that’s what they’ve done here.  It really makes me question if I want to do any further business with them.,855,"Does this statement reflect sentiment about Best Buy?

,,,"I really make a point to not purchase on Amazon as they are getting too big - so that means Best Buy when I can. Elite Plus member here - but barely. I rerouted a purchase to Best Buy in December to get me over the line for the next year.  I also managed to get a nice video card from Best Buy at MSRP last year because they did a nice job with the anti-bot tech - and didn't give in to raising prices beyond MSRP like for example newegg. I wrote a glowing review of the product and best buy because it felt like they were really batting for me ""Joe Consumer"" and being ethical about pricing. Next round of video cards were only made available to those who paid for Best Buy's Total Tech. Don't need that personally.  I'm in IT, I get the simplification piece of doing away with all the tiers - but that was sunk cost for the most part it seems. ""Simplification"" seems like a mostly made-up reason.   As other have said, this was a program that was clearly working to do what a rewards program should - routing dollars to the business instead of another business. To what level it is hard to say - maybe not enough. Feels like they are going the wrong way with this - and maybe Total Tech should have been included in Elite Plus as a perk.  All that said, I'm still routing my $ to BestBuy when possible to help them survive. They are the only real electronics store near me left. From there, my only options are Walmart and Target or maybe Kohls for small appliances - and they have a much more limited - and lower tier list of items for sale in store.",857,"Does this statement reflect sentiment about Best Buy?

,,,"TV came broken, didn't open for 4 months due to basement remodel, out of exchange period now. What can I do?; Bought an 82"" Samsung TV for my basement remodel during Black Friday. Remodel ran long so the TV sat safely in its box upstairs in an office. When the remodel finally finished early this month, I brought the TV down and unboxed it and turned it on just to find that the display was either defective or cracked. It looks like it took a bit of a hit before being boxed.      I have heard that this is not all that uncommon and that BestBuy or Samsung with generally take them back, but only during the 30 day exchange period. Since I was unaware of the fault (as I waited for the basement to be ready for the TV), I am quite a bit out of that 30 day period.      TV was purchased from BestBuy, but they are saying they can do nothing to help me. It has been more than 30 days, and they say anything after that falls under Samsung's window.      Samsung says that it is ""clearly accidental damage"" when I show them photos. I guess I understand where they may be coming from, but the TV has safely been in a box for the last few months. There was no damage to the box. They just say that I am lying.      It was purchased on Amex, but they seem to only give me extended protection for 60 days. Out of luck there too.

A customer wanted me to price match the one from Walmart. The one we sold was 109.99 while the one on Walmarts website was 99.00. I double checked by typing in the model number into Google to see if it would bring it up, and it did. I thought I read the numbers right and went ahead and price matched it.   The make, the color, that was the same.   Just found out the model number was NOT the same as I initially thought.   The model I sold her was 2149282.   The model I price matched was 2142925.   It was a major oversight on my part because I thought they were the same when I also looked it up in Walmarts online app. And I did it again but now it's saying it can't be found! I heard a horror story how Best BUY priced matched some premium appliances and as a result the company couldn't sell the appliances for years!   And a manager did approve of this he took me for my word! And now I feel like shit! Is he going to get in trouble because of me?! What should I do?

,,,"Pre $15/hr increase workers denied 3 percent raise. New employees at 1 year receive.; I've been with bestbuy since 2019. It was a soft place to land when I left my long term degree field career to follow my dream of being a highschool history teacher.  The promise of fair wages,  annual increases,  tuition reimbursement,  and flexible hours was a dream.  Though I had to scrimp and scrape to make that dream work.  I started at $10/hr part time,  and with hard work and great numbers for a noob was given the first available full time spot and moved to $10.50 roughly four months later, and eventually $10.95 at my one year with ""Rockstar"" across the board. I respected my managers and still do, they're great and genuine leaders. I think of my best buy Co workers as some of my closest friends and even family, while also brining friends on with the promise of a fair place to work as long as you're willing to do your job and learn new things while helping others ""discover what's possible"". When covid hit, there was no question in my mind that bestbuy was taking care of me, So, I would risk it and stay on curbside with only 7 other employees, and a couple managers in my store, deciding to not furlough. I had class, dealt with covid and was the best employee I could be for one of the best companies I had worked for. Finally, after covid we were all given increases to $15/hr starting wage. When people were staring to be let go because of the wage increase, I started looking for opportunities elsewhere. I quickly found a better paying job, plus commission at a spectrum retail location closer to home. Because I respect and care what my GM and ASM think, I went to them and asked them if I were in a position where it may come to down to having to choose between me and another employee to let me know, because I had another opportunity, though I didn't want to leave what I considered a home away from home. I was assured my job was never in question and a few days later was told I would be getting an increase of .50 cents that corporate had authorized GMs to give to employees that had deserved more than the $15/hr bump.

My 3 year mark just hit in September and I was expecting the 3 percent increase that the people hired in at $15/hr received when we first opened back after the shut down. Two cheques passed and nothing. So, I called HR. Where they started treating me like I was stupid, the lady tried to tell me my .50 cent increase that I've had for almost a year was my 3 percent. I ""kindly"" gave her a math lesson, that 3 percent of 15 is .47 and that I should have that on top of the .50 cents my GM gave me with the general increase. After telling the lady she could stop lying and should just tell me if I was getting the increase or not, she finally said because I went from $10.95/hr to $15/hr they were considering that my yearly increase and would not be seeing the three percent promised to every employee by Corey in our email about the $15 minimum. Well, turns out that if you started at $15, you do get the 3 percent. Allowing employees that have only been with the company for a year to make more than those that had been here for years. Me being lucky am .03 cents ahead of the noobs in my store, but there are others that started around the same time I did, still only making $15 at their three year. While mediocre, and even under performing 1 year associates, unwilling to lift anything heavier than a toaster or try to sell enablers are making more. I made million dollar club the same month I hit three years. looking at that and then 700 plus branded payments and 600 plus TTS, I've peddaled to my clients, I feel like I've been slapped in the face by a company that I had decided to stick with, because I felt I was appreciated and valued. Seeing that they value every year I've spent here as .01 cent higher per year than what they value someone who's been here for a year, or gone from part time to full-time.   I guess my question is, are there any other long time employees that feel completely betrayed by the company?

,,,"How my management lied to and scammed me.; So I got hired around October at age 16 to pay for my dad's heart surgery and our bills since he was our only income. I worked a steady schedule for 2 weeks, but nobody told me what to do. My co-workers had to help me get my start because management just completely forgot about me. Little did I know, the day I finished my E-Learning and got my blue shirt would be my last day there    I had worked about 8 days up until this point. As mentioned before, this would be the end. The next 2 weeks I had 0 hours scheduled. I had to come in and ask about it because nobody was returning my emails. My hiring manager told me they were cutting hours and things would be back to normal    2 more weeks passed and I still had not been scheduled, and had been informed after emailing my manager that the hour cuts were extended.    Black friday rolled around and I emailed asking if they needed me for black friday. At this point, I still had not been scheduled and nobody was returning my emails at all. About 2 weeks after black friday I came into the location because I was unable to log into the best buy app. I had emailed about this several times with no response. It is then that I found out I had been fired without even being told. The guy who checked the database and found out I was fired had no clue why, he just saw that my info was no longer in the database. I finally got in contact with my manager around January and he said to apply back in March, when they would be hiring again.    I didn't go looking for another job since he assured me that he wanted me back and it wasn't suppose to be like this. I emailed again in February to make sure I was still clear to re apply. He said yes.    Then a week ago after 3 emails, he finally responded asking my age and hours. I said 17 (because my bday had passed) and told him my hours. He responded and said that they want people who can work multiple positions and use equipment, and to wait until I'm 18.     So I had just spent half a year of my life with no income, under the assurance that I would be back to work. And don't forget that I had been secretly laid off, without being told. Not even after contacting them several times. This completely fucked us on my dad's heart surgery after his stroke, and our",1351,"Does this statement reflect sentiment about Best Buy?

They should be able to look at what you’ve experienced and determine if there’s anything actionable. Probably the biggest hurdle to your situation is whether or not any of this is in writing. For the initial hire there should be a paper trail and time sheets should still be available going back that far that an attorney could demand during the discovery phase. That should be able to corroborate your story up to the part where your employment was unexpectedly terminated. The conversations about getting rehired though, assuming they were all on the phone, will come down to your word against theirs.

,,,"Nice to see that you added it to guidelines!  The consequences of not having representation seems to be failing our peers that are being let go atm.  It also fails in that they just blame all failings on us, no matter that their decisions are what causes them.  This boot licking of just bending over and taking it that you advise isn't the way that things get better.  Using fear to keep people in line is toxic, demeaning, and unethical.  I refuse to let them keep doing myself and my co-workers so dirty.  All they have to do is ""be human"" and stop abusing us all.  It really isn't hard to just keep in mind that we are people that deserve respect.  They have done shockingly positive things for us workers even just 5 years ago.  So I know it can be done.  What they are doing now is causing burn outs and isn't sustainable given the ways they are cutting staff and effectively making full-timers the same as part-timers with regard to hours.  The way they are going is a great way to make quick money for the top, but will drop hard in the future.  When we are fired because of this, then I fail to see what is worth not doing something.  We will maybe get some small severances, while they will get multi-million dollar ones.  I am guessing that they are trying to somehow be acquired by Amazon with the drastic changes.  If we are being picked off, then we should be coming together and push back.  Believe it or not, I do like the company and want all of us to share in successes that can be had.  Harsh critiques are not always from hate, but many times are because you care and want to make things better.  So I know you care too.",1448,"Does this statement reflect sentiment about Best Buy?

,,,"Associate Product Manager opening help?; Hello, and thank you to whoever reads this post! It would be greatly appreciated if there was any feedback I could get from this.  Recently some openings for 5 Associate Product Manager opened up in Richfield MN. I am graduating from the UMN Carlson School of Management (BS Entrepreneurial Management and Strategic Management) in May 2021, and first of all I’m wondering if applying now would be too early?    Second, I have tons of internship/real job experience regardless of the fact that I’m just graduating, but I’m a little concerned I’m still unqualified?   1 year Marketing Internship with Pit Boss Grills 1 year Student Fee Management Committee  6 Mo Econ Development internship with City of Isanti 4 Mo-current Licensed Full Time Real Estate Agent with Re/Max  The minimum requirements are below, and honestly I feel like I actually kinda have most of these under my belt including some technicalities being that my degree I’m obtaining I literally did some of this verbatim, but not technically professionally.  “Minimum Requirements: • 1.5+ years of related experience in a professional environment/workplace setting with an emphasis on consumer products, technology, or software development • Track record of product roadmap execution; completing and shipping excellent products that deliver clear results • Proven ability to articulate clear and concise requirements for new products and new features Preferred Requirements: • Bachelor's degree in IT, Computer Science, Engineering, Business, Marketing, Communications or related field • 1+ year experience with Agile methodology • Experience presenting to peers and leaders • Ability to understand basic and complex architectural diagrams and data flows • Proven ability to influence cross-functional team(s) without formal authority • Proven ability to prioritize new feature launches based on competitive analysis, industry trends, emerging technologies, and company vision”  My biggest question would be am I shooting too high for an ambitious college grad?

,,,"Retaliation Prevention Policy: A Former Employee Story; I began my employment at one of Orlando’s Best Buy stores in 2018. Following a year after, I was sexually harassed by my supervisor in late 2019. After reporting that incident, my employment at Best Buy took the worst of turns.  While the store as a whole could agree that my supervisor’s overall behavior at work was questionable (just before being promoted as my supervisor, he had been documented for threatening to physically harm a customer.), his sales for the store were competitively high.  My former supervisor had the highest amount of Total Tech Support sales out of all the employees in the store, while his moods were not always pleasant, he was a crucial part of the team since he helped carry the store’s revenue.  During his short time as my supervisor, he crossed several boundaries which led to his termination. I do want to mention that during the process, the human resources representative assigned to my case during the investigation asked me a question which to this day, I cannot agree with.  *“Why didn’t you say something sooner?”*  This question does not feel sincere, but rather similar to an accusation. Talking about sexual harassment, sexual assault, rape, or any misconduct of that matter, is not an easy subject to open up about. Asking why a victim didn’t rush to speak out feels like a shift of blame. I hope in the future, companies begin to ask more appropriate questions that are more productive to their investigation.  My personal take: Never question the victim’s motives. If you are curious, here’s the answer- we are attempting to cope with whatever trauma we were forced to face.  After the termination of my supervisor, different managers began to share with me that the General Manager of the store was no longer fond of me. I was aware that his behavior towards me had changed. I think about the sexual harassment investigation, remembering my GM’s reaction when he sat next to me during a conference call with human resources.  I told the representative that I had shared with my coworkers the sexual harassment incidents that I had faced. I explained to the representative that I did not feel comfortable with the management at my store, which is why I never came to them. There had been a previous conflict that had occurred in my department which management had not handled professionally.  When I shared this information with the representative, I watched my GM bury his face into the palms of his hands.

,,,"had occurred in my department which management had not handled professionally.  When I shared this information with the representative, I watched my GM bury his face into the palms of his hands. My intention was never to embarrass the GM or the training of his staff, but to express to human resources why I didn’t feel comfortable confiding in management.  A few days after the termination of my supervisor, I had shared with my GM and the human resources team that I had a concern about an employee who is a family member of my former supervisor. He was a seasonal employee and was had a close relationship with my former supervisor, as they lived together and shared a car. During a casual conversation that I once had with him, he has shared with me that he had been in and out of jail for improper conduct regarding violent behavior.  I shared that conversation with my GM and expressed to him my fear of physical harm or retaliation from this employee. My GM responded to me, “he is seasonal, which means we don’t have to move forward with him. If I were you, I wouldn’t worry about it.”  This had given me peace of mind, until weeks later when I discovered that my GM kept him in the store with a promotion as a full-time employee.  I had felt so deceived by my own General Manager and I no longer felt safe working at the store.  Thinking about the days that followed, my dynamic with my GM changed. He began ignoring me at work. It was very uncomfortable to go into work, walking past each other while making eye-contact, and there being no acknowledgment from him. During some instances, I would be the bigger person and say hello or good morning, but when I did, I was blatantly ignored.  I changed my mindset and accepted that I would come into work to help clients and to stay out of my GM’s way. There did come a point where I was overwhelmed by how often management was warning me about his growing dislike towards me.  In addition, some of the management would tell me that my GM would persistently ask about my performance. They were told that if I was caught doing something that came remotely close to violating policy, to report the incident to my GM immediately. While this is a fair request, asking management to overlook their staff, why was I being targeted specifically? This had made me feel as if my General Manager wanted to ensure that I was under scrutiny.  I’ve always been the person to hear",1706,"Does this statement reflect sentiment about Best Buy?

,,,"While this is a fair request, asking management to overlook their staff, why was I being targeted specifically? This had made me feel as if my General Manager wanted to ensure that I was under scrutiny.  I’ve always been the person to hear bad news and to stay in a state of shock. I never questioned the management who’d warned me about my GM. I always nodded my head and absorbed the information, never wanting to continue a conversation about how I was potentially in a hostile work environment. To talk about it, was to acknowledge that it existed.  One day, I developed the courage to ask a manager . . .  Me: “Hey, do you know why it is that \[my GM\] doesn’t like me?”  Manager: “Did you ever see \[your former supervisor\]’s numbers?”  Me: “I guess, but he wasn’t a good employee, I thought?”  Manager: “Right, but you reported a problem that brought HR to fly in from out of state. That doesn’t make \[your GM\] look good in front of HR.”  After that answer, I knew at that moment that this was never going to end; my General Manager would see it through to have me terminated.  I received a disciplinary action form some weeks after my supervisor’s termination: a final warning. An employee had come to the store on their day off wanting to exchange a product that had been at an ex-boyfriends house, she had finally been able to retrieve it and wanted to upgrade it to something of a higher quality. I considered that Best Buy’s management always made exceptions outside of the return/exchange policy for customer satisfaction (this exception is a case-by-case decision).  Considering how I was told to look at out-of-policy transactions (to make exceptions for customers who are willing to spend more money during the exchange process.), I asked a nearby manager if my coworker could exchange an item that was out of policy. After the manager had approved the transaction, I was pulled into the GM’s office days later signing my first, final warning.  I had pondered for days wondering if having a manager’s approval still deemed the situation to be a violation of policy. My days of wondering ended soon after I was told that the write up was given solely to ensure that it was on my Best Buy employee record.  One of the managers shared with employees that the GM, being general manager, had the authority to choose",1707,"Does this statement reflect sentiment about Best Buy?

,,,"My days of wondering ended soon after I was told that the write up was given solely to ensure that it was on my Best Buy employee record.  One of the managers shared with employees that the GM, being general manager, had the authority to choose the severity of the write-up. Managers shared with employees that my General Manager wanted to ensure that I was put on a final warning.  I had a coworker call me after my shift that day, explaining that they felt that my write up was a form of retaliation. This was an employee who I had not shared any information about my investigation case or how I had been feeling ignored by my GM. However, before ending the call, the employee vowed to report their observations to Best Buy’s human resources.  I approached my GM the following week asking him to look into transferring me to another Best Buy location, but he never followed up with me as promised.  Months later, I called human resources to finally open up about my fear of retaliation from my General Manager. Human resources took note of my statement and opened a case, but they never reached out to me again after that phone call.  It would be wishful thinking to believe that this is all he-said, she-said, work nonsense. However, after having six different managers in the store confirm that my General Manager had it out for me, wishful thinking would be ignorance.  I am currently a former Best Buy employee. I do wonder at times, maybe if I had stopped my coworkers from making that call to Best Buy’s human resources department about my sexual harassment concern with my supervisor, I might still work for Best Buy. Perhaps I would’ve had the opportunity to leave on a good note, with the option of having my general manager as a reference for any future work opportunities. But I’ve come to accept that this isn’t my reality. Best Buy is now a closed chapter of my life.  My purpose for this lengthy reflection is for people to know the truth. The journey to creating a positive work environment for victims who have reported sexual harassment has a long way to go. In a place where I once called my second home, it became the place where I was scared to go to work and where I didn’t feel the support and acceptance from my management team.  I do not discourage women or men that want to report harassment in the workplace, once it’s seen through, it can be a sense of relief.

However, lately they’re saying employees that are “comfortable” assisting people without masks may do so. I asked for an SOP or other communication where it said that was an option and nothing was produced.   So... is my store leadership just being greedy and being unsafe on purpose? Or are other stores doing this too?

It's not that they make more money by default. In my area, they all max out at $18.22. That is not near what management make unless you get low balled as a manager or supervisor  Personally, I think SWAT should be pay grade 5 due to the fact that they are constantly researching, keeping contact with other stores and the warehouse, and just straight up managing the entire inventory integrity. SWAT is the inventory control leader in its own right. I would never do that job though lol  The next store level positions to get a pay bump currently after getting rid of FEL and BOL would be consultant (pay grade 9), senior consultant (Pay grade 11), GS senior (Pay grade 9), and  GS ARA (Pay grade 8) that is not management",2390,"Does this statement reflect sentiment about Best Buy?

""You have two weeks left here, then you will move all your appointments to that store, and train two very green technicians. You are responsible for dragging a failing install bay out of the mud, and into success, like the bay you run now.""  ""Uh, no. I will not do that, I like having a short commute. But let's say I do agree, what are you offering me to do this? This is a LOT more work than I have now, and a much longer commute. Surely you plan to incentivise me somehow, right?""  ""No, you are at cap, we cannot offer you a raise. Ever, actually. The next time you are up for a raise, we will calculate how much money that would add to your annual pay, and give it to you in a lump sum. So, you will get nothing right now.""  ""Yeah, no. Like, HELL no. I am underpaid as it is. If you won't compensate me, and I have to commute anyway, then I will find someone who WILL compensate me. I'll have a new job in the next couole days, in fact. You do not realize how valuable I am. This is a really stupid move. Best Buy doesn't realize how lucky they are to have me as it is.""

,,,"Ramblings about employee discounts; a fake example.; For those who don't know, 99% of consumer sales in all types of markets are facilitated by the distributor/OEM(aka dell/apple/asus). Same for any department store: Costco, Microcenter, etc.  So when a laptop is $300 off MSRP, best buy isn't taking that price hit, the OEM is.  **With that said, consider this example.**  A $1200 asus laptop might give an employee discount of $150($1050 after).  However, If it goes on consumer-facing sale for $900, typically, you lose your employee discount.  Remember, however, the OEM facilitated the sale. which is important, because BEST BUY is still making the same margin off of the new total of $900.   Basic math below:   \- $1200 MSRP with a best buy margin of 25% = **$240 gross profit**   \- $900 MSRP with best buy margin STILL at 25% = **$180 gross profit**  So, when sales happen, and we lose our discounts, which happens very often, it's hard not to be bitter at Best Buy. They seemingly strip an employee discount out of the picture while avoiding the PR hit.  Am I wrong here? This practice seems contrary to valuing employees. I was in distributor sales for quite some time and know how this stuff works for most types of markets (food, wine, cars, furniture).",2547,"Does this statement reflect sentiment about Best Buy?

,,,"It has been a mixed bag at our store.  One thing I like is it has helped out with coverage, which was my first concern with lay-offs. Shift leads can help open/close the building, which allows ""name-tag"" leaders to work during customer hours. I used to have to spend 4-5 hours hosting and engagement leading, whereas now I can spread that time amongst the shift leads and use that time to coach and train.  I also like that it is encouraging our employees to make decisions on ""basic"" MOD calls. So for example, does a supervisor or above really need to answer the ""Can I get an MOD to front lanes for a return question?"" When its for an opened product 3 days outside the return window. Like, y'all should know the policy, make a decision.   However, I do have concerns that the company has lowered the threshold to obtain keys and alarm codes.  There's also a lot of mixed messaging around shift lead expectations. I just got off a teams call where our marketplace AVP warned us to stop calling shift lead a position, and to refer to it as a task. ""Our shift leads are not supervisors."" And he's not wrong - it's not a job code. It's a task in TLC. But then he, our market HR, and my marketplace director (GM) turn around and list off all the things they want from our shift leads, and all of them sound very supervisory   This has caused tension amongst current shift leads. In the past, I was able to leverage the work I did as SWAT, for example, to get promoted. No one was paying me for the MOD calls I took as a non-leader. But now we are paying them for their shift lead work. And we're paying them like shit for it. So it's caused the issue where if we so much as ask ""hey can so and so shadow you today"" we get ""oh I'm not coded shift lead today so no.""  We don't want to abuse their help - like, yes they should get paid for leadership tasking - but it does bring up a lot of questions about personal brand and how you are supposed to carry yourself.

,,,Samsung's OLED tvs are QDOLED made by Samsung display. LG display makes standard WOLED panels.  Sony as of right now buys from both LG display and Samsung display.

This is the only correct answer.  Edit: There might be a circumstance I could see where LG merely supplied Samsung with the OLED tech but Samsung still has to turn that OLED into a QDOLED since if you go more in depth they're the same type just structured differently with coatings and subpixels and quantum dots and blah blah blah now we are into a different subject entirely.,2615,"Does this statement reflect sentiment about Best Buy?

,,,I'm no expert but LG has the G3 which uses MLA which is LG answer to Sony and Samsungs QD-OLED because the didn't invest into QD OLED. MLA does get the G3 really bright tho which is why it's in the comparison with the S95C and A95L  LG G3 is not a QD-OLED LG does not make one.   Side note Samsung does not consider the S95C as their flagship tv either so many experts believe it's full capabilities are being held back  S95C is too expensive imo I'd go for the G3 but damn the S95B is probably best price to performance tv we've seen in a while. The No Dolby vision for the S95 is a turnoff but a lot of reviewers say the difference is a non factor for most  Editing cuz I release you also asked about panels MLA are LG panels   QD-OLED are Samsungs own panels,2618,"Does this statement reflect sentiment about Best Buy?

,,,"From everything I've seen and read, this is a true quantum dot OLED manufactured by Samsung Display. LG has nothing to do with this tech as Samsung Display is using a different subpixel layout for their screens compared to what LG has produced.   As to Sony, I believe they procure most of their OLED panels from LG, but I believe their QD panel is from Samsung. This I'm far less certain on, as I don't keep up with the stories around Sony.  But as far as the S95C is concerned, it is a Samsung Display and a true QD-OLED. I also think Samsung has a superior offering: in addition to the better display tech because of QD-OLED, I strongly dislike any display that has a hardwired power cord. Why LG does this with most of their OLED TVs is beyond me. That Samsung has not just a detachable power cord, but also a One Connect box, puts them way in front of what LG is offering.",2619,"Does this statement reflect sentiment about Best Buy?

,,,"Long answer here...  Samsung Display and LG Display make OLED panels. They are separate from Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics. Think of them more like sister companies.   LG Display makes WOLED (also called WRGB, the emphasis is on the W meaning a white subpixel is added). Up until last year, that was the only panel available, and Sony (and others) used LGs panel in their OLEDs.   LG Display's goal is to sell as many panels as possible, so they actually loved Sony and others buying their panels. When Sony started winning the King of TV Shootout over LG, they didn't care because it was still Display's panel. Of course LG Electronics wasn't happy about it 😜.  Samsung Electronics firmly supports QLED as the premier tech and NOT OLED (even the QD variety). They have been very vocal in their anti-OLED stance. But they are affected by changes to their sister company Samsung Display.  Samsung Display used to make only LED panels. But LED panel production has slowly been shifting to China as Chinese companies can make them much cheaper. No one wants to buy a Chinese tv, but no one realizes where the panel in their tv comes from, so manufacturers are going to go with the cheapest panel available that performs to the required specs.   That means Samsung Display knew they had to get out of the LED panel business. Enter QD-OLED. They shifted to producing QD-OLED panels last year with really poor results to start. When they first were producing them, they had about a 30% yield (only 3 out of 10 panels survived the process). However, by the end of the year that number flipped to like 75% which was an incredible turnaround.   Sony saw the potential in QD-OLED and bought in almost immediately, which is very unlike Sony, who usually does not buy in on brand new technology. Samsung Electronics still wanted no part in OLEDs though, so they would not make a QD-OLED at first. Speculation here, but the thought is eventually the Samsung parent company stepped in and forced SSE to buy the panels from SSD or else SSD would have had difficulty not going under.   While the QD panels were being developed, LG was working on the MLA panel. Completely different technology, but one that can get brightness equivalent to that of QD (although colors still aren't at the WD level).  For this",2620,"Does this statement reflect sentiment about Best Buy? Label the sentiment as positive (1), negative (-1), or neutral/irrelevant (0)."
,,,"While the QD panels were being developed, LG was working on the MLA panel. Completely different technology, but one that can get brightness equivalent to that of QD (although colors still aren't at the WD level).  For this year, the end result is LG will use LG Display's WOLED and MLA panels for their lineup. The 55, 65, and 77 G3 will use MLA, everything else will use the traditional WOLED panel (of which there are a couple of variations). This includes the 83"" G3 which will not be MLA (MLA panel not available in that size yet).  Sony will use the LG's WOLED in the A80L (all sizes), and Samsung's QD-OLED in the A95L.  Samsung will use their QD-OLED panels in their S90C and S95C. They are also probably going to have a WOLED model later this year with an LG Display panel.   Quick explanation of panels... OLED is inherently a dimmer technology, so it's all about getting the best color while maintaining brightness. Very simple explanation here, but WOLED uses a white subpixel, then filters it to make Red/Green/Blue light. This filtering process removes energy/brightness from the light, so white light is then reintroduced to brighten the image.   MLA uses tiny lenses to amplify the light and make it brighter, leading to a brighter picture and potentially less white light needed to brighten the picture.   QD-OLED uses quantum dots, which rather than filter light actually transforms light to the color of the crystal used. The panel started with blue light (the strongest wavelength of R/G/B) and then either passes the blue light straight through or hits the Red or Green quantum crystal. The energy from the blue light activates the crystal which gives off its corresponding color. You get bright colors without introducing white.   WOLEDs look great, but there is a slight whitewashing of colors (particularly reds). If that's all you've ever seen you would never even realize it. A QD-OLED makes much more vivid reds and can even produce shades or reds that have never been displayed on a tv before. When you watch demos on the A95 or S90/95, pay attention to the reds.   Theoretically the MLA should be able to do better colors too since the lenses allow less reliance on white",2621,"Does this statement reflect sentiment about Best Buy?

,,,Watchs videos from stop the fomo on YouTube.   I believe you can tell if you look at it under a magnifier device and see the difference between a woled (lg oled with white subpixel)   rumors are s90c is woled this year and the s95c is newer gen qdoled. Can say after installing them both the s95c looks brighter for sure,2623,"Does this statement reflect sentiment about Best Buy?

Problems arise from people just putting them in the recycling area, Gaylord, hazardous waste bins in the warehouse or trying to PRC them.   Like I said.... lack of training or willingness to learn.

,,,"Restructuring to Micromarket; The micromarket Company restructure was piloted for about 2 years in NY and essentially became the company  gold standard... The idea is simply put as so - the micromarket would work like one big store (how SWAS was before) however resources are deployable from the Hub store (hence why Hub stores have the most headcount and generally the best of the best)... If a micromarket has 3 stores, picture those 3 stores as 1 big store - that's the idea behind the cuts and deployable labor from the hub store - in so many words, it's like a ""loyalty 1"" but to another store vs another department... From this perspective, you don't need 3 GSMs but 1 Services experience manager (the best GSM supposedly) to run this ""big store"" or MM and the other 2 GSMs would get cut... Evaluations were made based on personal ranking submitted to GM, GM rankings of leaders submitted to MM director (also the hub store GM but not really - they are like a DM of their MM but do have the Hub store as their home location) and then ""in partnership"" with AVP (Marketplace manager, more to come) and HR and 3rd party company (DEI/ESG) - decisions were made on who would stay and who would leave... How those decisions were made were never explained to the individuals getting severance so that was essentially a mystery except to the parties involved in the decision making... Many stores were left in complete shock at who was retained and how the leaders were let go (basically, the leaders were scheduled to work and during their shift, they were given the scripted speech with their severance information, hopes of roles popping open soon in JOS, and being walk out the building without telling anyone what just happened and not being able to say bye to their teams). The main concern with the scheduled sit down severance speeches were to ensure that ""GMs got the store keys back to prevent having to rekey the buildings"" - as far as how the leader felt or having an opportunity to speak to anyone, that was placed at 0% priority or concern.  The Micromarket restructuring started about a year ago and I may have missed a few areas however, in general, this is pretty accurate.   Corporate: many mergers and cuts occurred there as well, I don't have too many details as that was outside of my wheelhouse however, it was very impactful",2740,"Does this statement reflect sentiment about Best Buy?

,,,"may have missed a few areas however, in general, this is pretty accurate.   Corporate: many mergers and cuts occurred there as well, I don't have too many details as that was outside of my wheelhouse however, it was very impactful when I was informed.  Territory, Market, District: essentially all of those leaders and their staff were absorbed into a ""Marketplace"". A marketplace is like 3-4 districts from a legacy perspective (which was like 2 markets to go a little further) and managed by an AVP (assistant Vice President)... So obviously, there were a lot of cuts from the territory, market and district levels (many of those leaders saw the writing on the wall and left beforehand)... Many went the corporate route or multichannel/unit route or home services route (as remote work was and still is overemphasized and overresourced however, still pretty safe in comparison to employees inside 4 walls) and then the rest were simply laid off... Many hundreds of years of tenure gone down the drain.  Field Agents: Essentially cut in half, this happened like a week ago around independence day.  Precinct: GSMs cut (there is one Services Experience manager per micromarket now in store and some stores have a services supervisor but not all).   Sales: all ASMs cut in half (with the exception of one Hub store per micromarket which may have 2-3 ASM - experience managers as they are called now, will be responsible and accountable for both Sales and Ops and will have a few weeks to learn the ropes). All SSMs cut whether appliances, connected, mobile, etc - they generally got absorbed into the Sup staffing headcount... Sups cut down to 2 or 3 maximum per store with 1 possibly being services supervisor for GSP (again, not every store had this Staffing Headcount - some stores got rid of GSM and the Senior is running the show in partnership with MM services experience manager). From sales, it's safe to say that at least 50% of the leaders were laid off (if you go from the furlough days of pandemic - you can say that 50% advisors have been cut since then as well although, this was not part of the micromarket op model) and what was replaced was a bucket of 40 hours per week per store of labor in leadership bucket for shift leads... If a store has 6 shift leads for example, each will get ""up",2741,"Does this statement reflect sentiment about Best Buy?

,,,"was not part of the micromarket op model) and what was replaced was a bucket of 40 hours per week per store of labor in leadership bucket for shift leads... If a store has 6 shift leads for example, each will get ""up to"" 7 hours of Shift lead pay per week - some more than others depending on how many managerial tasks/duties they are assigned... Shift leads are essentially supposed to be your ""cream of the crop"" talent (although many stores were amateurishly handing out the position like candy on Halloween - how we used to do with backup VPLs in the past - and now are battling an uphill battle with the selections they made)... The way it should work is that SL get scheduled that labor ""activity"" (as it is not a Job Code per se but more of a skillset you schedule like you would a ""monthly training"" or ""new hire"") after being certified via elearnings and leadership approval in Learning Network... Those SLs should have been the best hourly line level employees and essentially were runner-up for Sup roles or what have you... The problem that is occurring in store now is that, there is a nudge coming from leadership that basically states the following ""a SL performs managerial duties when scheduled; a good SL performs managerial duties when needed; a great SL performs managerial duties at all times"" - the conflict arises when these SLs forget that they still have to contribute to store Performance and Look and Feel causing a ""power trip"" effect and fellow advisors getting upset at their high horse syndrome... Some more intelligent veteran SLs say, ""I will only perform key calls, overrides, MOD resolutions, etc while I'm being paid as SL"" because they are aware that there would be no promotional opportunity any time soon... This will by far be the greatest hurdle for the company as many of these veteran advisors working as SLs are not ""drinking the juice"" and feel that the company cut a plethora of leaders yet the job still remains to complete - end result, the SL must perform and/or verify the task completion for lesser pay than previous Sups and without the name tag title to go along with... Obviously, this causes conflicts among advisors who are not SLs as jealousy or envy or even misunderstanding of the SL role causes internal discomfort and conflicts.  Product flow: essentially now a team which are led by shift leads (on a daily basis however, the EM for each",2742,"Does this statement reflect sentiment about Best Buy?

,,,"causes conflicts among advisors who are not SLs as jealousy or envy or even misunderstanding of the SL role causes internal discomfort and conflicts.  Product flow: essentially now a team which are led by shift leads (on a daily basis however, the EM for each store in partnership with GM and MM director could make a Sup in charge of Ops but not company directive). The traditional daily tasks, Merch, plano, Swat, Truck, etc are all merged into a bucket of labor now - there isn't a direct leader in the warehouse per se simply some SLs unless a MM decides to use a Sup for Ops (highly unlikely yet, some do have a process or Specialty Coach that may be utilized for ""setting direction"" in the MM)... As in the sales floor dilemmas, PF probably has much more as things like Truck night are being led by an able bodied advisor yet, they may back off the actual physical labor and ""manage"" the truck team the whole night... The ""too many chiefs, not enough Indians"" conflict arises (just as it does on the Sales floor) and many of the SLs have slim to no experience in actual people leading to diffuse the conflicts and create reasonable solutions... Again, the greatest issue will be getting the SL program under control as many may confuse the job activity with the job title and feel empowered to believe they are no longer required to roll their sleeves up and work.  Outcome - apparently, NY micromarket stated that it took quite some time to get it figured out but that they love it now... I can say this was said to me by a few GMs when I was doing training with them (they kept winning on many of the scorecards at the time and it sparked my curiosity)... Turnover is expected of course and as cold as that may seem, it's actually calculated and even taken into account with salary compensation for those employees moving forward.  Many are not in favor and feel that these changes and restructurings are occurring so quickly that uncertainty and employee morale are at an all time low... These changes including the changes that occurred with Total Tech (TTS, TT, MBBYTotal, etc) are all signs of amateur leadership from the top or signs of potential financial distress - definitely not well organized or thorough...

,,,"I’d like to clear up how bonuses work for you guys.  Source: former SSM under the bonus structure l. I’m an inhome agent now.  Best Buy manager bonuses has three components - Revenue, Operating Income, and Shared Success. They used to all be weighted a third but I believe it’s like 40/40/20 now.  Memberships are profitable and help with OI, but there is no bonuses for hitting membership goals. Bad leaders don’t explain the WHY of membership.  The strategy is that with the card it gives them more buying power to get all the services and accessories (Rev and OI) and with Plus and Total is incentivized repeat business. (Which is why you should be hearing about relational customers vs transactional customers in your coaching)  But there has never been a bonus for memberships but memberships are the leading indicator of hitting Rev and OI.  Shared success is a mystery metric though. It’s basically the part of your bonus that when the big bosses get to bonus, you get some too. It’s not a super controllable metric at the store level.",2821,"Does this statement reflect sentiment about Best Buy? Label the sentiment as positive (1), negative (-1), or neutral/irrelevant (0)."

,,,"I start with the plus. First looking to see if whatever they’re buying or considering to buy offers member deals. I call it a 60 day price match policy and explain we run sales every week and chances are the item they’re buying might go on sale within the two months. Also show member deals on my phone that they will get if they become a member and how it’s update almost daily. I bring up total if we start talking about protection or services to be done.   By the way this is all done while talking to them about products and brought up early. Don’t mention price of the membership unless they ask. You’ll find your own way to pitch it but once you get it down, it’s not that hard. I’m pushing Plus way more than total. When you pitch both of them at the same time, customers get lost and stop caring.",2845,"Does this statement reflect sentiment about Best Buy? Label the sentiment as positive (1), negative (-1), or neutral/irrelevant (0)."
,,,"The two biggest differences between the two are the free in store services and the included protection plan. Asking questions like “do you shop here a lot?” And “do you usually buy warranties on your devices?” is a great way to break the ice on getting into the membership conversation. Me personally I like to find a specific item they’re looking for before getting into any of that talk and I’ll give you a example. Greet customer , pull up their account. “Hey David I see you’re not a cardholder or member with us , just to let you know all of our laptops currently are 0% interest for 12 months if you wanted to take advantage of that, we also do have some great membership benefits but I’ll get into that a little more later”. You find laptop they want. “Great choice, I do have a couple more questions, do you plan on buying a protection plan for this laptop?” Are you going to be needing a data transfer from your old device to this new one?” If they answer yes to those you should SHOW them the $179 membership, we are visual beings, SHOW them the savings , “I did briefly mention about membership benefits and I do believe our $179 membership is going to be fantastic for you, along with included protection up to 2 years on this device and majority of other items you buy all of our in store services are free meaning we can transfer your data to your new device for free, how does that sound?”  If they yes great! Briefly go over the extra benefits like 60 day return policy and member pricing . If they aren’t interested that’s where you ask them if they shop here a lot, and SHOW them our member deals in the app or ssk(when it works ha ha). If they seem interested that’s where you mention the $49.99 membership . In general if I can find a laptop/tv on a membership price that fits the specs and needs of the customer I tend to bring them to that specific sku first because if they aren’t interested in total it’s much easier to transition into plus because most of the time that member price pays for the membership on the initial purchase.",2846,"Does this statement reflect sentiment about Best Buy?

,,,"I would go with LG, and here's why. I was a Home Theater Agent that did repairs on TVs. The number one TV I hated going out to fix was Sony. Especially if we had to deal with the factory warranty and put up with their bullshit. We would do a triage, and that wouldn't fix the TV all the time. Then, they would send part after part  until it was past 30 days or if the cost was BER (Beyond Economical Repair) on their end. Before I left, a poor elderly client was still waiting to get his Sony tv replaced after almost 3 months of multiple agents trying to fix it, but Sony wouldn't replace it. Sony's are great when they work, but after having to deal with them for 5 years on repairs and the headaches they have given us and clients. I refuse to buy a Sony TV. I would rather buy myself an LG OLED any day. It is much easier to deal with and easy to fix. I also didn't have to repair a lot of them. Samsung, I did repair the most, but those repairs are not a problem at all. They were the easiest to repair, but like I said, they do get serviced a lot. If you're going to get a Sony, then get the GSP plan. The process through the Geek Squad was simpler than the factory warranty but still a pain in the ass to fix. Sorry for the paragraph. I can say a lot more, but I bet no one is reading this far.  TL:DR - Sony is a pain in the ass to deal with for this repair agent.",3001,"Does this statement reflect sentiment about Best Buy?

,,,"Sony is great but they have their own rare issues. Lg makes a great OLED and some nice LEDs but I think Samsung and Sony fair better on the LED side of things. Even their flagship the qned85 is nice, I think most of our customers would be quite happy with the picture quality. But Samsung and Sony LED's are just more impressive to me. Even if you set all 3 to their respective filmmaker mode. Samsung has a lot of brand loyalty in my area and we do capitalize. Hell I got Samsung's. I've heard they have more failure's and seeing how many people complain is kinda how we would know about a failure rate. But I've also seen LG and Sony have failures pretty bad. If asked I'll tell them that, probably has a higher failure rate, but I don't think the risk differential is all that great. Definitely a compromise tv for me. But a pretty damn good one on the high end. But this year even their low end it pretty good. I think the cu7000 is actually a little impressive in the shadows and a decent brightness for a crystal uhd. Likewise from the x77l from Sony.  Lg uq series tv's look bland by comparison on the low end and their qned ain't quite as nice on the high end. Tcl and hisense came out swinging with the qm8 and u8 tv's but my store doesn't have those to display. Only the cheaper ones. Which still provide a good value for what they are but I know they would sell like crazy if people could see them.

Or worse, “I get incentives on this brand so buy this one”. A little research and you’ll find it entirely depends on the customers wants and “needs”. While Samsung makes the best brightroom TV, Hisense makes a wonderful midrange contender. LG dominates on the OLED side but not every category because LG has a wildly varying range of good, better, and best both Samsung and Sony have good contenders. Samsung has more service calls because they almost out sale at a 2 to 1 ratio over all the other brands. But if you look at percentages they are all pretty close to each other in terms of sales to service.  And if the customer is that concerned about needing a service call or wants more comprehensive coverage that’s literally why Best Buy has the gold standard in warranty. Especially right now, because of such an aging market more often that not the older models have a better price to quality ratio that makes it hard to get a 2023 version of TV.",3008,"Does this statement reflect sentiment about Best Buy?

Work with them and they should work with you (though I know many managers are unreasonable…).   - Politely decline to be posted at an answer center. If no sales person is available, clients can work with a leader (who should be leading by example btw), or wait in queue like we do during the holidays.   - Remind them that NPS may tank due to extended repair times.   - Clients we have promised to work for take precedent over new clients.

,,,"Snapped in June. Where I’m at now.; Hey all.  I was with BBY for 5 years.  Started as a sup, did some temp salary work, and finished as a GSM - snapped in June.  I wanted to provide a little perspective and share where I am today in hopes of helping those in similar circumstances or for the rest of you that have had enough.   First, I’d like to point out that I saw the snap coming, and was not surprised when I got the axe.  I saw the direction that the company was taking: less leadership, low/no specialization of line levels, and more top-level influence on site.  With this in mind, severance was my desired outcome, and it was nice to get handed a check to not come back again.   I’m not rich, but am in a good position financially, so I committed to two things in my job search:  1) I set up a system/rhythm that I confirmed to daily.  2) No applications for positions that paid less than what I was making when I exited BBY.  3) No applications for something I wasn’t interested in, regardless of pay.  4) Try like hell to avoid retail. 5) Apply to jobs not in my wheelhouse - look for a new path and emphasize transferable skills.  6) Take my time and enjoy the extended vacation.   I’ve had a number of interviews since then, and what seems like 10x that number in rejections, but I wasn’t deterred and stuck to my system.  I’m starting a position next week that pays 15% more than my (capped) GSM pay.  In addition to a comparable benefit package, they also provide biannual reviews, guaranteed equity, and doesn’t require a flexible schedule. They told me they’d send me a laptop - assumed I’d be getting a Chromebook from the pre-COVID era, but instead I got an M2 MacBook Air.  have a slightly larger team, but there are no customers, which is a benefit in and of itself.  Before I started looking, I didn’t know this position existed, and while it’s in the tech field, it’s unlike anything I’ve done before.   The point is that if you’ve been laid off and you’re still looking, or if you’re looking for greener pastures, make sure you widen your approach. I don’t agree with the direction that BBY is headed,",3106,"Does this statement reflect sentiment about Best Buy? Label the sentiment as positive (1), negative (-1), or neutral/irrelevant (0)."

I don’t agree with the direction that BBY is headed, but as far as retail is concerned, it’s still an above average place to work.  You’re not going to escape shitty customers or new initiatives or flavor of the month KPIs just because you switch polos.  If you hate working at BBY, you probably don’t like retail. It takes courage to break away from the safety net that the retail industry provides - there’s almost no barrier to entry to land a spot, jobs are always available, and the promise of “opportunity” is always there.  In reality, and with some exceptions, the real opportunity is outside of retail.  Get creative, and leverage your skillset to land at a place that understands your potential.

,,,"Never used Reddit outside of finding the TLC log in; My name is T, jokingly called T-Rex at work which makes my day. I have been with my current Best Buy store since 2013. I have been through so many changes from departments to staff to memberships. Retail has always been described as a stepping stone job but the thing I loved about it was the customer experience. Helping people find what they need, not just what they think they want, solving the never ending problems in the electronics world and building bonds with customers. I have customers still to this day I've been helping since 2013. I've seen their kids grow up and seen some of them go off to college. I've learned a lot, grown a lot and tried to help those around me grow as well. I have gone through a lot with the company like cut backs, mass hiring, many holidays. I had an ASM Ramon who I could easily say was such a supportive and amazing person to guide paths for so many. 2018 I went through something that took a lot out of me mentally (my mom got really sick) and by 2019 she had left this world. Some of my Best Buy experience during this time was supportive. Being a person who had to take caregivers leave when it first released was a learning experience, asking for LOA when she went to hospice was disparaging when it was declined cause I didn't have the right paperwork, only to lose my mom before they approved it. Telling my GM I needed more time than the bereavement time allotted because I was going through a large amount of depression and anxiety and having him support me taking time. Making so many friends and watching them leave for school or other jobs. I was there for 24/7, Total Tech Support, Total Tech to even the new plan. Rallying behind decisions that obviously I have no control over but hoping to inform customers the best way I can. The moral has been so down lately and it takes a toll on the brain. Constant red floors due to lack of staff, people leaving, the grind for memberships (which I don't mind but I do feel like since I deal with so many repeat customers what more can I do if they have already gotten the credit card from me or the TTS to TT and conversions). I love helping customers and getting to learn about their lives. I just feel run down. Everyone is mad about the changes and most will just tell me if you aren't happy",3155,"Does this statement reflect sentiment about Best Buy?

,,,"Going to see if they want to hire me to train their employees to better understand bestbuys systems. Getting tired of not doing something about it and the seemingly higher higher ups ups seemingly perfectly fine to let things stand.   Also, looking to see if any accountability can be had. Essentially if a cx comes in with erroneous information from 3pl, through recent interactions/breeze you can see the case the rep made. If it's an actual bestbuy employee that made the case, it's easy to see the organization structure of that employee, so you can get their bosses information if something needs to be addressed, or you can message the employee directly through teams to coach out something real quick. This accountability doesn't exist for 3PL call centers.   When I did work digital sales, there was a chicken guy that existed when transferring to another department (at the time I always transferred with the customer)  In that instance, I passed off the cx by having another rep reach out to them and I stayed on the line with the chicken guy. Nothing but roosters clucking. There wasn't an actual person on the line, just chickens.   I stayed on that line for 4 hours, refusing to believe that digital sales leadership has zero ability to get chicken guy fired. Also stayed on the line cause if chicken guy was with me, then there wasn't any chance of another transfer. Also, it made their numbers look horrible so I hoped with the stone walling of leadership, at least maybe someone in the 3pl call center leadership would see the long call, listen in, and then hold chicken guy accountable.   Didn't work though, swear chicken guy is still going strong as I have heard a cx or two cone in and say all they got were chickens on the line when needing help.  Anyways, at the time, I spent a good amount of my shift trying to find some more detailed information about our 3pl call centers to maybe, hopefully get a good contact number. Digital sales leadership at the time refused to give any info, didn't care, or just remained willfully ignorant of the issue.   I did find some documents with names. I think there were 3 names I found for different regions.  Today, when I generally googled, I came across Sitel (which is now called foundever) that I think bestbuy uses. SITEL sounds familiar.

,,,"Couple of points of view here..  Yes, there is absolutely accountability for 3pl teams. In fact, they have an enormous turn over rate which is actually a problem.   That leads my to my other point. If you want to really help, joining a 3pl company isn't the answer in my opinion. Even if you did and even if it was a training or QA role, you still may make a relatively small but positive move. If you really want to change that world, you need to move up through BBCC leadership. Usually a Sr. Analyst owns the relationship of a 3pl team, so that may be a good place to look into.  Next steps up (Associate Manager, Manager, Sr. Manager) you would have conversations with the 3pl Sr. Leadership, work with and own contracts, negotiate new teams etc.. then I'd say you can make a substantial impact.   As for chicken guy, if you get that information to the right team with the time you called and the number you called from, the leaders can absolutely pull the call. That said, 1 occurrence doesn't typically end in terminating that employee. Just like you or any W2 employee, it would usually be a verbal warning at first but if it's that agregious it may not be the first warning.",3195,"Does this statement reflect sentiment about Best Buy?

I can’t share what the company-wide shrink number was but store-level losses far outweigh what it would take to staff the role and treat it the way every other big box retailer treats security.

When I informed her of that, she told me to check all the other best buys. In the area. Well, one of them had it. But that location was 20 min from my store. She wanted me to call that store, have them keep their doors open, just so she could get the item. I told her I was not doing that and reminded her of our hours.

The gist of it is sundays are the absolute worst day to be front end the entire first 1-2 hours of the doors being open are straight up returns and customer service complaint after compliant. Anyway, my front end partner and I get through the initial COD zombie wave of returners that for some reason camp the doors every god damn Sunday and a middle age woman come up to me to buy some shitty headphones. No big deal, I scan the product, “your total is 24.99” or something like that. “No.” “What?” “It’s 19.99 I want to buy it for 19.99”  Not sure if it was the overall bad mood I was in but I threw my politeness out the window and very plainly said back “No it’s 24.99, if it was in the wrong place or the tag was wrong or something like that it’s kind of why we have barcodes.” “You don’t have to explain shopping to me, I saw the tag it was for 19.99”  I say let’s go see where you got this from. Tag obviously a completely different item and yep sure enough there’s 4 of the EXACT same boxes of headphones right next to the 19.99 tag on a rack that says 24.99. I explain the whole process again and show her the  UPC’s match the 24.99 tag and she thinks I’m trying to scam her. Walks up to the host stand demands to have me fired and storms out.

Even with using the right Dolly's and the right lifts it's still an extreme task, multiple times a week to do these things on your own. It's always meant to be a ""team lift"" where needed, yet we fired and cut so many people and scheduled people the bare minimum that team lifting anything is impossible when you're alone or the other people in the warehouse are injured... essentially making you do it alone.  The sales floor doesn't help, they hide behind their registers in groups of 2 to 4 at a time with leaders laughing and joking while you break your back daily and they don't even have the decency or respect to offer help. They're happy to accommodate their lunches and work needs to get bonuses....but any type of team work where they might break a sweat or get dirt on their hands...think again.

Took over a 2+ year dark install bay and my 2nd year there, was about to get added headcount as it was add 60 hours every week. Then came Corrie and Covid. Bonuses stripped and bay was shut down moving me to another location. I was turned down for Supervisor spots for the past 5 years that I was more than qualified for and watched them give them to people with less experience and 0 skills.

I'm pretty sure this was retaliation for some things I said in the Blueprint Survey as his attitude changed completely towards me right after the results came out.

,,,"I am in the same position as you, only difference is this is my first full week at best buy, I started Sunday, and I re-started school this semester. I believe it's all up to the type of managers you get. I applied for a part time retail sales associate position and on my first day when they asked me again for my availability they messed it up not an hour later. I told them I cannot work on Mondays and Wednesdays, also on Tuesdays before 2pm. Every other day I could work from opening to closing. They ended up scheduling me for Monday afternoon, Tuesday morning, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday.   So they gave me a full time 40 hours, two days when I can't work, and in the product flow position which isn't sales from my understanding; it's warehouse. I had to remind them three times to change it; when they made the mistake, at my lunch, and when I clocked out. They finally changed it when I said I won't be coming in at all.  My revised schedule is Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday this week at 32 hours. It still says product flow, but I'll see how and what it is when I work on Thursday. I did start applying for other jobs again though, as it seems my store will be a pain to deal with when it comes scheduling.",3692,"Does this statement reflect sentiment about Best Buy?

,,,"Depends on the management tbh. Some will be chodes about your availability, others will work with you on it. FT gets tuition reimbursement but, they expect 100% open availability despite the company rules on that saying otherwise. The downside to bby is, they will be making you do about 3 or 4 people's jobs with no training and hound you on apps and memberships constantly. It will quickly drain all your energy and stress you out to the point where you either just become deoressed and stop caring about literally anything, or you'll quit and be back on the job hunt.",3694,"Does this statement reflect sentiment about Best Buy?

,,,"""Employee Discount is 5% over cost. You also get a discount on services Best Buy sells. If the markup is less than 5%, you pay the retail price. You'll always pay the lowest price available.   **The discount kicks in after 30 days of employment. Between November 20th and December 31st, however, everyone can make purchases despite their respective hire date.**  Discount is for personal use only, and you cannot disclose your employee purchase price since it is confidential information. Eligible users include you, a spouse/domestic partner, and dependents under the age of 23. Eligible family members can come with and pick-out an item for themselves, but you need to buy it. All non-cash payments must be made in your name. They can't use your Employee number & ID to purchase a product on their own.  To check the discount on an item, copy the SKU and navigate to the Personal tab on ETK. Paste the SKU on the Employee Price Check section.

,,,Don't let them bother you. I'm in the same boat as you are and the best advice I can give you is to try to find value in the Plus or Total membership for the customer. Of course even if it saves them money and gives them peace of mind they may not take it. It should be a natural part of the conversation and not something you just bring up randomly. It's why getting to know your customer's problem is so important. You match what they need with the benefits of a membership and see if it'll provide value for them. If not it never hurts to ask just in case but ultimately don't sweat it if you don't end up getting the membership. BB business model is awful and it's not your fault the company relies on those memberships to make money. Take what I say with a grain of salt though I rarely ever make my daily quota.

I told him I cannot do Wednesdays but for some reason i got scheduled for the Wednesday before thanksgiving.....As well as i do warehouse but he knows that I did front end last seasonal(i told him) and he said ""for black friday ill have you do front end/checkout"" except for that fact that i recently told him i do not remember the pos system or anything else(i worked at kohls for awhile and do not remember pos at all) and he has not given me a shift to at least shadow someone as well as we have plenty people in sales who can do checkout/front end. he also made my BF shift starting at 5am-2pm not to mention he has people who applied as sales in fucking warehouse btw. im not gonna do checkout/front end when its not my job and dont remember how tf to do it. he also doesnt schedule me and i have to ask when to come in....what do i do here(still dont have my blue shirt btw im annoyed by that for some reason) one last fun thing...our truck was fucked and he just took a pic laughed and left....I love best buy",4007,"Does this statement reflect sentiment about Best Buy?

,,,"For our store, it’s pretty straightforward. Driver will back up, you’ll get paper from them. We’ll pop open the trailer door and usually there’s a tote of straps and an envelope with manifest info and seals. The seal you put on when you’re done is the just a +1 from the seal you took off (I.e. if seal you take off is 111111, next will be 111112 ). On the tc, I’ll log into rss and go to shipping and receiving. You can find the manifest number from the paperwork in the envelope or search using your DC’s number and a marking a shipped status. It’ll pull up the manifest on the tc, and there will be a little arrow near the top for a drop down menu. From there, I go into manifest validation scan units as I pull them off. Once everything is unloaded and validated, I’ll usually suspend it and back out. I’m not sure on other stores policies, but you can receive it there and have the picks come through for units. If you have anything to load, go to shipping and receiving, and under the containers tab hit the plus button. If there’s geek squad units (they’ll have a white container instead of red, as well as a pink slip usually) you’ll hit unload trailer. You’ll have to scan the BOL number, usually really long and on the paperwork the driver handed to you or from the envelope. Then you’ll scan the white containers to “unload” those units. After that, RSS will ask you if you want to load that trailer. This is for haul aways, service units, etc. you can hit yes and scan the containers to load them. (If you have nothing to unload, just hit the same plus button and just go to the load trailer option, then scan containers of units ready to send off. If there’s nothing to unload or load, forget this step). If you loaded units, when you complete the loading, some paperwork should print out. 3 copies. You’ll sign your name and date under shipper on all these copies, plus the paperwork the driver handed you. Go out to the driver, giving him his paperwork back.

If there is another store’s stuff in front of our stuff, unload and set aside. This stuff must go back on the shuttle at the end, non-negotiable. o	Log into EBOL and select unload trailer – do this on the MC40. It’s under Applications>Sign>EBOL>Load/Unload Trailer. 	Scan the long and skinny barcode on the paperwork that the truck driver gave you. Should start with lots of 00000s. This will begin the unload. 	Open item appliances, Geek Squad receiving, inter-store transfers all have EBOL’s on them. Scan the EBOL’s as you unload the truck to check them into our location. o	Unload our stuff (and only our stuff – the various stores on the shuttle are separated by straps across the truck, but make sure batch labels and EBOL’s say your store number on the stuff you take off). o	TV’s and new appliances are on a manifest (look up in RSS under manifests). Unload and set aside.  	This manifest MUST be detail counted with a Truck Count sheet (clipboard in the Trucket) filled out. If anything is missing we need to send the form (can do tomorrow, but you have to do the counts). o	Load the other store’s stuff back on. o	Hit “finish” in EBOL – it will ask if you want to load the trailer, hit yes. o	Start loading the trailer - scan the EBOLs – very important for tracking. o	Priority for loading (in case stuff doesn’t fit and has to wait for the next shuttle) is: •	Geeksquad service stuff •	Requested transfers •	Transfers (PRC, inter-store, SMWH) •	Totes •	Recycling/pallets o	Make sure everything is strapped in tight so that it doesn’t fall over or damage other things – this can be very expensive. o	Complete loading in EBOL. -	Close the truck and put the new seal on (located in the envelope with the truck paperwork). -	Sign paperwork and give back to driver. -	Count the items on the manifest and fill out count validation sheet (put on SWAT desk when",4085,"Does this statement reflect sentiment about Best Buy?

,,,"A lot of the internet attorneys on here need to give up their “licenses” to practice internet law.   There are plenty of credible resources regarding employment and HIPPA on the internet. Especially where the info is specific to doctor’s excuses. Go to those resources instead of these faceless, credential lacking, unregulated internet lawyers for your guidance.  I’ll suggest looking at the sites of law firms that specialize in employment law and sick leave rights. When those attorneys say “The HIPAA privacy rule states that an employer may request a doctor’s note from an employee, but only if it is necessary for an acceptable reason, like sick leave, Workers’ Compensation, or health insurance.”, it tells you that responses suggesting  employers can’t require a doctors excuse are wrong. It could possibly still be contrary to a company’s internal policy, but that still doesn’t make it illegal.  In my place of employment, the doctor’s excuses need only read that “Mr. Smith was seen in my office for illness or treatment and can return to work on this date with or without these restrictions”. If there are no restrictions, you’re allowed back to work. If there are restrictions, if the job you do can accommodate those restrictions, then you can come back to work. If we cannot accommodate those restrictions,  you can’t return to work until those restrictions are lifted. Which also means a return to the doctor to provide the statement saying no restrictions. And that only means time off with pay if you have the PTO to burn. If you don’t, you are off in an unpaid status. And in all of this, we obtain no information that violates HIPPA.  One thing to note is that if you don’t have the PTO and you aren’t in a protected status such as FMLA, you can be terminated for excessive absences. The loss of  a minimum wage job in a job rich environment may not be a big deal to a lot of people, but job history and a previous employer saying nothing more than “ineligible for rehire” may impact your ability to replace that job or to get a position that is actually a well paying job down the road.  And who came up with or approved  these policies? Attorneys licensed to practice law in our State. Not some yahoo practicing internet law.",4484,"Does this statement reflect sentiment about Best Buy?

I know when a customer is buying something or not, and many times I'll function check small stuff while they are blabbing their story. Average around 2 totals a day usually on top of that. If a customer is going on too long I let them know we gotta end it there for the 20 min consult. Our ARAs prefer to call clients. Etc. This results in us having SO MUCH free time while still making more labor than we spent (we are positive labor for a while now and even donating our hours). We also do not help code 1's because corporate told our managers we are not to do that. (Our managers were making us do customer service ALWAYS, and so we emailed HR and forwarded our managers asking about it. HR replied and told us that customer service and front lanes are NOT in geek squads job responsibilities. Because of that they refuse to even call us for code 1's. Always remember if you are being taken advantage of, make a paper trail and ask hr if it's allowed. The moment they say no, your store will back off entirely.) So many times we are found doing nothing in the back being lazy and having fun :) but every store member knows they can come to us for anything, we often will buddy up and help our store associates sell a total by them bringing their client to us to ""techy explain"" some technology or benefits.

,,,"In my 5 years with BBY and observing coworkers, whenever someone moves from sales advisor to product flow/warehouse, they never transfer back to sales and I assume they like/prefer the “warehouse” job functions and duties. I have also seen one and only one warehouse employee (who was a newer employee) unloading pallets off the truck SOLO- so regardless of scheduling/call outs/ weather & holiday issues/ that truck still needs to be unloaded and becomes your responsibility to get it done and unloaded. Depending on floor coverage, I have seen advisors enlisted to help but it’s not often nor is it “their” responsibility to get it done- it’s yours, lol again it really depends on your stores leadership and management style- to know how good/bad your store’s warehouse is functioning.   Then the next move from warehouse/product flow is to Geek Squad delivery/install. These positions (at least in our store) rarely open up but that could be also another option for you.

I’ve worked with many people; most good, honest, and hard working.   I tried working in an office for two years while being O/S and I hated it. I thought that the nature of the work was a net positive for the world. I learned quickly that the grass isn’t always greener, it’s just a matter of how well you maintain it. I came back and switched roles again. Felt like I was home.  I started at the bottom as a part time home business group sales associate. I know the anxiety of only having 12 hours on my schedule. The resentment towards others receiving preferential treatment. The realization that life isn’t fair and that sometimes you come up short. All these lessons hurt but I still learned a lot about not only myself but how the business works.   Best Buy is a company that’s being ruined from the top down, but it’s provided a lot for me and my family. I have two good cars and time off to enjoy working on them. I can see my family and friends regularly. I wouldn’t have graduated college without this job, nor would I ever be in a place where I felt I could finally become a father.   I don’t know how much longer this company has. It can be ten years or ten months. But it gave me an education and a hell of a resume.

,,,"Erosion is a very broad spectrum that comes from a lot of different places. Internal and external factors come into play for a lot of it. I won’t go into specifics on it because I’m sure you know about theft, inventory issues, bad returns/exchanges etc.. as for the walking business aspect. From my understanding the company prides itself on giving the customer you are with a 10/10 experience while providing a complete solution for them. If you can build that trust and relationship with your customer then you will gaining a potential long term or life long customer who will shop more often and spend more money. Unfortunately that means you walk a lot of other customers due to not having product or long wait times. The company stands by their commitment that they would rather walk many more potential customers if it means the ones that are in front of us are taken care of. Which in retrospect, if we don’t forcibly change the customers way of thinking and how to shop then it won’t even matter. The plan is move all that to instore/in home consultant and designers who can give that experience and build a package and everyone else needs to order online for store pickup. The stores will become just show rooms with minimal grab and go product on display. (Think Apple Store or carrier phone store). This will reduce a lot of retail operating costs and make up for all the erosion that you speak of. Best Buy is going to become a cross between a vendor show room with demos and an Amazon fulfillment type center for item pickup.

A lot of it too is the member pricing, look for computers that have a member price or one that isn’t on sale, yes a lot of customers don’t see the value in plus because we as employees don’t see that value in plus, make it make sense for them.   For apps, find the objection tbh. If you’re struggling it’s pitch, price, or product. Either they don’t like the pitch, they don’t believe the monized value is enough, or they don’t believe in credit cards. For the 10% back option find out how they are paying, if they are paying in debit, tell them we can pay it today and give you x amount of money in rewards. They only thing you can do is offer and eventually you will get the results you want.

Our busy season last fiscal year had us booked out at least a month in advance while these last few months we've been booked out at MOST 8 or 9 days during our supposed busy season. At one point I was pulling shifts as a CA up at the precinct because labor was so short, now they're pulling labor from the precinct so I can still work my hours doing what I enjoy in my designated position. The problem now is our precinct is running into a labor shortage as well and I feel as if management will probably start cutting us down to 1 CA and 1 ARA at any given time.  Technically our bay is supposed to have a part time and a full time tech, but was changed years before I was moved to autotech and we have 2 full time. My thoughts are by the end of summer they will either drop my position to part time or kill it entirely since it's no longer sustainable because we aren't generating enough labor to pay for it, or close our bay entirely and expand our warehouse.

,,,"Flex pay & Wage groups are broken for ARAs; Im an ARA and i've been with the company coming up on 7 years, 3 of those with GS. In an effort to meander my way into more responsibility, I became our stores first shift lead back when the program went national and I did it to be able to help out my team, grow my skills, and overcome obstacles that not having access to certain systems presented. Great, except theres one glaring issue: Im an ARA and the shift lead program was clearly never intended to have ARAs become shift lead capable.  For an advisor or CA in wage group 10, the bump to base pay WG40 when scheduled as a lead makes sense, it may not be a big bump depending on how close they are to cap, but generally you still make something going from WG10 to WG40. The issue is that the flex pay program for shift leads automatically puts you at the base rate of WG40, even if you're someone like myself who makes more than that. What does that mean? It means that when I get scheduled as a lead, I actually take a pay cut of $1.22 despite going from WG30 to WG40 because im approaching cap. Because of this, its not been sensible for me to be scheduled as a lead for going on a year now, but because I don't mind the extra work I'm used as a floating lead essentially whenever I work.  You would think I would put my foot down and be angry that I get no additional compensation for the extra work (part of me is), but to be honest most of what I do and have access to just make my job and my precincts job easier so I look over it (IE: Schedule making, overrides, NOVA admin, back office/superuser, procurement/ariba, DBT - but NOT powerBI since you have to be scheduled as a lead once every 7 days for powerBI to populate data).  Being said, even though i've basically accepted the extra responsibility, it still doesn't cover up the fact that the flex pay program and wage group system is broken when it comes to ARAs or anyone outside of WG10 as a whole.",5580,"Does this statement reflect sentiment about Best Buy? Label the sentiment as positive (1), negative (-1), or neutral/irrelevant (0)."
,,,"Talk to your leaders. An ARA can be scheduled in a different department and keep their pay if the ""activity"" is still Entitlement.

,,,This is the reason I declined becoming an official shift lead when the program rolled out. Was told I couldn’t get a pay diff because I made more in my current role as a senior. Pissed off the ASM and GM. Now I cover the floor for 4 hours a week and get told I should come to sales on a daily basis,5582,"Does this statement reflect sentiment about Best Buy?

,,,"I go from $22 to $16.37 if they don't make sure I'm under WG30.

,,,This has been a thing since they first introduced flex pay. They stopped it for a while because most people flexed down on pay while they revamped it. As an ARA you technically can’t be a SL because of this issue. Your pay grade is higher than the advisors and would have the issue of flexing down like you’re experiencing.,5584,"Does this statement reflect sentiment about Best Buy? Label the sentiment as positive (1), negative (-1), or neutral/irrelevant (0)."
,,,"Thats not entirely true unfortunately. While its true that the labor comes in the form of leadership, BOP, FOP, etc, and the activity can be virtually whatever they would like, the job is what determines your pay, such as sales generalist WG10, Consultation WG10, precinct repair WG30, and the three shift leads (Employee, Process and customer) WG40.   Changing the job from WG30 to WG10 for example, as in an ARA being scheduled to work as a CA, changes your wages for that job from your primary pay to a ""pay-by-job"" rate. If you go down a WG, such as going WG30 down to WG10, then you get the highest pay available for WG10, but if you go up a WG such as WG30 to WG40 then you go to the lowest pay of that WG even if your normal pay is higher. The only reason im confident in saying this is because we experimented with this several months back and discovered that both scenarios (going up to WG40 and down to WG10) do exactly as I outlined.  In principle that should still be fine since you should be able to just keep the job as the default, while changing department to leadership and activity to leadership which then just flags the mix as bad and you just manually approve it, however market and corporate HR are cracking down on this and telling stores to stop doing this since it completely negates the flex pay and pay-by-job system.",5585,"Does this statement reflect sentiment about Best Buy?

,,,"And therein lies the rub: it means that officially, ARAs can't skill up like advisors can. The equivalent for us would be if CIA was a non-permanent role like leads but since its not it means on paper we have no avenue.

On the official [Geek Squad History](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/geek-squad/history-of-geek-squad/pcmcat1494529157815.c?id=pcmcat1494529157815&intl=nosplash) Website under BestBuy is written..and I quote: *""No matter where you bought it (the tech appliances), Geek Squad can help with your tech and appliance products. We have Agents available 24/7 by phone or through online chat, and at any Best Buy store"".*  So this also includes products NOT BOUGHT with a My BestBuy Total Membership active...  So. Who is right in this case? Should I believe my manager or the website? What would be the differences between a tech support service from a chat with the Geek Squad Agent to a customer without any memberships, to a customer that have the Total Membership?  I need to know because this is bugging me from a while ago and I need some answers. I do not want to ask other supervisors in my store because I don't want him engaged in a fight or conflict because of this...",5619,"Does this statement reflect sentiment about Best Buy?

,,,"The difference is going to be the pricing. Yes, someone without a membership can still get support, but they're going to pay out of pocket for every single instance and it adds up quickly. I had a client not too long ago who, when I took a look at his profile, had spent over $300 worth in multiple online support sessions in the last year... when he could have paid $179 and had unlimited access to 24/7 tech support for the year instead.   For in-store services, a tuneup/malware removal service alone costs $150. Most clients who come to us needing us to scan their laptop for viruses are people who ""need"" Geek Squad, so it makes more sense for them to get Total for $30 extra and have the freedom to connect to 24/7 support or bring their device back to the store at any point during their membership instead of paying $150 or more for us to help them one time.",5620,"Does this statement reflect sentiment about Best Buy?

,,,What it says on the website is right but it doesn’t mean that repair or data services are free. Consults are free but anything beyond that requires payment. That’s how it’s always been and how businesses run.
