I worked there in 2016-17 started in PT sales and worked my way up to FT sales lead until my role was discontinued 1 week into the position. The benefits are just okay and discount pretty generous. However, they focus very hard on unrealistic sales goals, management can be very pushy, and they restructure\/eliminate positions\/headcount ALL THE TIME.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMore recently, I returned to BBY part time in warehouse (1 day a week, just barely working enough for the discount), but later left just before the holiday season because I did not want to work anymore hours and they were really pressuring me to work. It was a bit more relaxed for me the second time around, mainly because it was 4 hours a week and I did not really care. Warehouse is still very metric\/numbers driven, but it's different because you don't have to deal with customers as much, and most of the goals are pretty obtainable depending on how organized your warehouse team is. Although, it's almost impossible to move up in warehouse as your strengths don't show as much as they would in sales\/customer service.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat being said, it can be very easy to move up if you have a positive attitude, play the game of being peppy in their cringe company culture, and obtain\/exceed your sales goals. With the turnover, you could land yourself a supervisor position in just a few years. Just don't be discouraged when they restructure and eliminate it, I can guarantee you at some point it will happen.\n\nIf you've worked for Walmart, I'm sure BBY is the better option, just learn to play their game. I could be wrong, but I would peg BBY to be in a similar line as Target & Starbucks in regards to quality of the company, but this is just observations and I could be wrong.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've also heard Costco has decent benefits, but can't speak to the internal workings of the company and culture.

I know exactly how you feel. If you are bored enough to read my stupid life story:\n\nI was part of the grand opening team for a Best Buy in 2006.  35,000 ft.\u00b2 I was full-time media, basically a senior, but without the actual position or pay.  We had six managers, 12 supervisors, many seniors, and full timers.\n\nI went through the reorg in 2009 and barely kept my position. Supervisors drop to five, managers drop to four.  My stress gave me ulcers.  Our goals got to unrealistic math levels.  In gaming we had to have 8% service plans, accessories 12.5%, 3% geek squad set up services for consoles ($30 to turn the system on and run updates lol).  I had done the math at the time and management was unpleasant with me when I said this was not possible. Nintendo Wii accessory sales when we had no wii remotes 70 nunchucks.  Assuming we literally sold geek squad, black tie protection on each possible device we would not hit our numbers.  And that\u2019s assuming that customers come in and literally buy everything we tell them to.  \n\nSpeaking of more unrealistic, I was told on a Monday morning to replace all of the price tag\u2019s in gaming, because the wordage for performance replacement, plan (PRP) was rebranded to geek squad black-tie protection replacement plan (GSBTPRP).  I remember telling them that it wasn\u2019t going to happen today and they got upset. Then I used math to show them that approximately 30 4ft sections of games, each having six shelves, minimum seven tags per row assuming that each game magically had its own spot on the shelf and wasn\u2019t stacked in front of another game.  Telzon taking about 10sec per tag in our shitty faraday cage of a store.  Takes about 10 sec to remove old tag and put on new tag.  35 hours of labor assuming the tag printer doesn\u2019t jam, zero customers need help, etc.  and all of this was less than 24 hours after an adset, so basically we had to redo adset is what corporate wanted.  management hated me.\n\nThen there was the gaming initiative in 2011 where I was so optimistic that things were turning around.  \n\nAt this point I was trying to raise a family and thought this would actually be my career. But then we didn\u2019t receive enough labor for our team full-time or had to work 32 1\/2 hours supervisor 37 minimum.  We had two part-timers that got about 12 hours each.  Best Buy was talking about how bad shrink was and gaming, just like it always has been, and just like it always will be, but we did not have the labor to be staffed during each open hour.  Not to mention any labor for truck, adset, etc.\n\nThen my position was removed August 2012.  The writing was on the wall.  I could either take severance or any of the available full-time positions that would exist.  Problem is there are three stores in our area, not counting the Best Buy mobiles.  So it was a dog pile of people for one or two positions that paid less than what we made five years ago at that point.  \n\nI took the severance, eight years of professional workmanship gone.  but a lot of my former friends and colleagues were still stuck on the Best Buy train wreck.  I joined this sub Reddit just to see how things have been going but it\u2019s not very optimistic. Most of my bad dreams have been of regular work at Best Buy.\n\nNow, almost everyone I know is out of Best Buy and has long since moved on. Years ago, Best Buy got rid of 401(k), matching I remember reading. Which is the most petty way of saying we don\u2019t care about our employees and we are pretending that this is a cost savings measure.  The few old coworkers that remained said that they are sharing a manager between multiple stores. Almost nobody is full-time. They have like two supervisors. Which means some key holders are literally part time, so have no stake in the company.  All risk no reward.  Pay is capped at comical levels.\n\nI just needed to get all that off my chest.

They can transfer the data and make sure everything is working. If you have any questions a few weeks after using it, they can come back out. Typically appointments are $130+ per visit, but with TT, it would just be $200 for the entire year.\u201d If they start to roll their eyes, I usually feel weird because sales feels gross, so I say, \u201cI know, I have to mention it because it\u2019s a really good deal,\u201d and then I will just move right along. Maybe mention it again a little later, \u201cso you\u2019re going to set this up and transfer your data yourself, right?\u201d *As I type this, I am realizing I am a manipulative little shit and maybe I do like sales hmm\u2026*\n\nDo you know any of the Geek Squad agents in your precinct? I know salespeople in the store will mention my name when they offer in-home services; It may feel more personable that way. If you mention a specific agent with experience in what you\u2019re client is purchasing, they may feel like they are getting the hook-up *(\u201cChristineth is our Apple guru so if you\u2019re having iCloud issues, we could book an appointment for her to come sync your devices AND show you how to use this Apple Pencil I am selling you?\u201d)* and it might help the client feel more comfortable with an agent coming out if they don\u2019t typically utilize home services. *Hmm it\u2019s just Christineth. She won\u2019t judge my model train collection.*\n\nIf you sell a printer, you can have an agent set it up on the client\u2019s Wi-Fi, show them how to print\/scan from any device, how to replace the cartridges, all that printer stuff. If there are any issues with said printer, GS can come back out to troubleshoot.\n\nOffer installation for security cameras, tablets, doorbells, modem\/routers, TVs, soundbars, computer speakers, smart switches, a Roku, etc. I have gone to homes to set up a $20 wireless mouse or connect a $40 webcam. Probably unlikely that you will be able to sell $200 memberships on a little accessory like that very often, but I think it helps to talk about it with everyone. Some people are rich and dumb as hell. I say that with love. \n\nIf they are buying one thing and mention their slow internet, an agent can come out, set up the product and check the internet speeds\/equipment while they are there (just make sure to book the appointment with enough time).\n\nThe warranty that is included with TT is pretty baller too + vague in-store discounts lol.\n\nI know selling things kind of sucks and can feel weird and degrading, but you don\u2019t have to be a sleazy car salesman to offer a year\u2019s worth of support.

I understand that help is needed through the store in other departments but my issue is that leadership sees it as an \u201cexpectation\u201d that we flex to help. SOP clearly states that VPLs cannot be used as coverage for other departments. \u201cBuT wE\u2019rE nOt HiTtInG gOaLs\u201d Okay? That doesn\u2019t mean they can just ignore policy. When it was brought up that we weren\u2019t happy about SOP being ignored, they basically told us to deal with it. But when it came to me taking an hour lunch rather than 45 minutes, guess what I was told? SOP clearly states we are only allowed 45 minutes. Funny how SOP only matters when it benefits the leaders and not the employees that the leaders have to rely on in the first place to even help make them look good. I applied for this position so that I could have specific responsibilities and I haven\u2019t been able to do them. My vendor pad is basically an afterthought.

It is very telling how badly workers have been groomed to default to freaking out and attacking one another on topics like this.  The folks that start calling for fellow humans to just \"work or leave\" have been lost to us and go out of their way to viciously defend corp and store leadership.  If they put that same energy into standing in solidarity with their fellow workers, we wouldn't even need a walkout of any kind.  Because if we did stand together we could actually be at the table.  \n\nI have had some very good times and met lots of friends and other cool people at BBY.  It has had times where they showed attempts at good-faith employee relations.  Also the point of said walkout is about those of us that actually care about making the company better.  The bootlickers yell \"don't like it, then leave!\" shit as if just finding a new job is like buying candy, and like we shouldn't be treated like humans.  Doing something like a walkout or forming a union is all what happens when the \"correct\" channels are taken but ignored.  They do so much that just counteracts everything we are constantly told.  We are the ones that have to deal with any and all customer\/client rage and confusion that comes from badly setup ideas changing in ways that go against how large chunks of said shoppers\/clients expect things.  Corp will just keep bad ideas going even if it is painfully obvious that it isn't working.  The folks that seem to make the plans are all super disconnected from the real world and real people (and I imagine they just want to speed up the latter fast enough to not be the one to deal with blow back).  If the stuff isn't working based on back and white metrics, it is us that are surely the issue and not their \"amazing idea\".  \n\nThe current setup is based on trying to make more and more money than the record breaking years of 2020 and 2021 isn't sustainable.  Those years shouldn't be used in the same way that normal years are.  Sales went nuts because all of a sudden so many people had to quickly get or upgrade stuff to simply keep working and\/or going to school.  Much like how so many streaming services are seeing big drops in subs.  Of course more people will sign up for streaming media when they can't go places like they normally would.  Which also means that projections for those services shouldn't keep planning for those numbers to keep growing instead of dropping.  So we see budgets slashed, things canceled, and lots and lots of workers laid off in desperate efforts to make the numbers look like things are still booming from a shareholders standpoint.  Which can only work for so long (especially if top people keep giving themselves higher and higher bonuses) before everything just falls apart dramatically. \n\nIf we didn't care, then obviously we would just leave.  We need things to be done in ways that work for both workers and the top.  If they are going to keep forcing us to watch lame elearnings about \"mental health importance\" and \"really caring about respecting each other\".  Then they could also start doing stuff that materially impacts workers lives in positive ways.  The \"customer obsession and building relationships\" nonsense is completely undermined by running everything so super lean in all departments.  Leaders freak the hell out if even two people are in a line, and just drag others that are already helping in some way into it.  But they could've allowed more people to be helped by getting in there and doing it themselves.  All that running around to find someone is time they could've just did it.  I hope that the stores that were the starting point of this walkout go through with it and in big numbers (I may if it happens in my area).  They can fire us all, but at a certain point it bites them hard if they were to do so.  All the extra and useless stuff needed to train new people has gotten so bad in some departments that it couldn't be done fast enough.  \n\nWe just want respect and not constant gaslighting with threats that go along with it.  We want to not be doing all the jobs at the same time (especially when it is stuff that is outside our capacity).  The company used to have people that knew shit about their departments and could really answer questions or give advice to customers\/clients.  Now in the moment Google and pray for real and not scam shit is normal.  We could fix so much of the new inefficiencies by having real scheduling and staffing.  No more of the \"just deal with it\" stress and stop attacking us.  \n\nSolidarity forever!","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/z1mzn6\/bf_walk_out\/ixg1vwa\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"BestBuyWorkers","reddit_link_id":"t3_z1mzn6","reddit_parent_id":"t1_ixf3jfj","reddit_submission":"z1mzn6"},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2022-11-22T21:23:40","reddit_id":"ixfpkh1","reddit_name":"t1_ixfpkh1","reddit_created_utc":1669170220,"reddit_author":"bbythrowaway8675309","reddit_text":"The main sub has corporate employees running it, so they ban a lot of conversations there.

She can't do anything to you officially, but you may want to distance yourself from her as she may allow her frustration to motivate her to file false things about you, and if I read you correctly, she's already threatening you for making more.

For background, I'm a college student in my late 20's. Been working in retail for nearly a decade. I didn't finish my bachelor's when I was younger, but I went back to school last year to finish my degree so I don't have to work retail for the rest of my life. I am in a fortunate position with scholarships and financial aid that I don't necessarily need to work while I'm in school, but I thought I'd stick with Best Buy for a little extra cash and for the employee discount.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen my current semester started a couple of weeks ago I quickly realized that my homework and assigned readings are going to be far more time-consuming than previous semesters. So a week and a half ago I informed my GM that I was giving my two weeks notice so I could focus exclusively on my studies. He basically disregarded me and said I'd have to speak with my immediate supervisor, who was on vacation at the time. The following week I had to call off on truck night because I had too much homework, and my ASM manager calls me saying I need to manage my time better and that they'll just schedule me for less shifts or on different days. And like the GM, he just ignored that fact that I said I'm quitting and continued to schedule me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen when I was working this weekend, my ASM again tried to talk to me about my schedule in a very manipulative way, ignoring me when I say I'm quitting and continuing to talk about just working less hours or staying on as occasional\/seasonal. I finally had to assert myself and clearly confirm that I am quitting. Then I ask to confirm that my last shift will be in the coming week, and my ASM says, \"No, you just gave your two-week notice, so you will have to work two more weeks,\" completely ignoring the fact that I had already given my two-week notice to the GM more than a week previous. On this same shift I'm dealing with the usual understaffing that my store and every other store has been dealing with. For the final two-thirds of my 9.5-hour shift I was the only product flow employee in the store. I was so stressed out during that shift that I was seriously considering walking out mid-shift and never coming back. I did finish my shift, but there is no way in hell I'm staying with this company.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince my managers will not listen to me, I am seriously considering just employing the quitting-by-not-showing-up method, which is not something I ever thought I'd do, but what other choice do I have?","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/xcctn9\/managers_not_letting_me_quit\/","reddit_title":"Managers not letting me quit??","reddit_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/xcctn9\/managers_not_letting_me_quit\/","reddit_subreddit":"BestBuyWorkers","reddit_link_id":null,"reddit_parent_id":null,"reddit_submission":null},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2022-09-12T10:01:41","reddit_id":"io4gnnc","reddit_name":"t1_io4gnnc","reddit_created_utc":1662991301,"reddit_author":"Ok-Neighborhood-4158","reddit_text":"You should write or type a job abandonment letter ASAP.

You are correct, there is nothing wrong (depending on the local laws) with recording in public places. However, retail locations and most other businesses are not public areas. It is private property that you are allowed to come purchase items from during certain times of the day. Actual public areas fall along the lines of sidewalks, streets, parks, etc. They are usually locations owned by the city\/state and paid for by taxpayers (the general public).

I don't know all the specifics however the main ones that I remember are:\n\n* You have to be making a gift purchase to be given to an individual for individual use, or to a qualified non-profit organization\n* Cannot purchase items for use in for profit business, or to be intended for resale using employee discount \n* Employee cannot be reimbursed by the person\/organization you're giving the gift to\n* Additionally, it is my understanding that employees may purchase GSP\/ Protection and services\/ installations as qualified gifts as well.  If you purchase through dotcom make sure the shipping\/ delivery address is for that person, not your address\n* I personally recommended that the services\/ GSP be setup in the name of the person \/ organization you're giving the gift to\n* Also recommend that you put the gift purchase on it's own sale\/purchase and don't combine with other personal purchases\n* Strongly recommend you provide the giftee with a gift receipt, if not a copy of the actual receipt for their records, and in case anything happens where they have to warranty claim on it.\n*  If you're shipping to a different store for pickup, make sure you list the person picking up the product's actual first and last name as it says on their state issued ID, and tell them to bring state issued ID with them to pickup.\n\nFinally, be aware that employee purchases, including qualified gifts, are tracked and can be scrutinized by internal audit \/ asset protection teams and discounted goods\/ services\/ etc. may also count as taxable non-wage income on your W-2. If you have specific questions, don't take my word for it--follow up with a inquiry to HR about the qualified gift policy to make sure you're making the right choices and following the procedures correctly. \n\nTLDR: Yes you can use employee discount for QUALIFIED GIFTS.

Her \"vision\" is for a single worker in a store manning a pick up counter, period, with no thought to logistics, services, customer experience and certainly not employees. She WILL eventually cut EVERY full time worker- management, sales, warehouse, distribution and everything else. The endgame appears to be reduce Best Buy to being an IP that will be sold to Amazon and Amazon will take over the actual operational costs while it gains a  retail showroom. So for any of you who thought that timeline was somewhere far off in the future, take a HARD look at a week ago, the second massive layoff in two years.\n\nShe is intentionally crippling the stores so that she can justify closing them when sales inevitably fall after lack of service drives customers completely out of brick and mortar. Her \"facts\" used to justify doing this are a set of self-fulfilling dictums which falsely inflate online sales figures while minimizing brick and mortar contributions, and she's either too greedy or too stupid to see that either she is being fed bad information or more likely, she is the source of that misinformation.\n\nRight now, cutting staff can produce short term gains, but it is at the cost of long-term stability and sustainability and she knows that. When the stock value inevitably starts tanking hard and doesn't stop, the short term losses it causes will be assets, as she and the board can buy back even more shares of the company and when the sale to Amazon goes through, those shares will become worth billions. You aren't allowed to read about this on the \"other\" sub because the mods there are in bed with corporate and even though almost ALL of this information is public, discussion of it is actively suppressed, so for anyone who is thinking of making a career out of Best Buy, think twice.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/wkca45\/just_so_its_clear\/","reddit_title":"Just so it's clear","reddit_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/wkca45\/just_so_its_clear\/","reddit_subreddit":"BestBuyWorkers","reddit_link_id":null,"reddit_parent_id":null,"reddit_submission":null},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2022-08-09T16:34:41","reddit_id":"ijmn6m9","reddit_name":"t1_ijmn6m9","reddit_created_utc":1660077281,"reddit_author":"Ellioment","reddit_text":"Where can I see all this publicly??

Anyway - I\u2019m a customer, my grandparents are old and decided they wanted to buy us new appliances for our first house. We bought 4 LG appliances to get the 10% off instant rebate, but ended up having to do 2 separate transactions online because the fridge would show as out of stock unless it was the only thing being purchased. This messed up the instant 10% rebate. \n\nI talked to a lot of people at customer service (online and on the phone) about it and finally someone understood. He talked to his supervisor and was able to get approval to issue me $900 in gift cards instead of a refund. Okay, cool, no biggie. He said it would be split into 2 because of the high dollar amount.  Again, cool.  After 2 hours on the phone, he assured me we were good to go and gave me a reference number \u201cjust in case.\u201d \n\nI called in today to ask if they could give me the gift card number over the phone so I could make on online purchase before the physical cards arrive. After being transferred 4 times, I finally am talking to someone who says he can help. The previous people had mentioned they saw the cards were issued, but couldn\u2019t see the codes due to the high dollar amount. The rep I\u2019m talking to eventually tells me that that those gift cards weren\u2019t actually issued and I wouldn\u2019t be getting them. He said it was because one gift card had already been issued to me and they can only do one gift card per order. The gift card I had received was for like $150 because I had a hell of a time getting the contractors to come out and install the waterline for my fridge. The conversation ended with me talking to his supervisor who told me he could offer a gift card for $200 but that was it. He said he was the highest level of supervisor to talk to, he agreed I was entitled to the full $900 but said he could only do $200 and that I shouldn\u2019t have trusted the previous reps that I had talked to?? I asked if he could connect me to someone else or if there was a customer relations department and he said he didn\u2019t know and suggested I could hang up and call back to talk to someone else. \n\nAm I SOL or what can I do here? My nearest store is over an hour away. Do I just wait and hope they show up in the mail? Any suggestions are greatly appreciated. \n\nSorry for the formatting - no excuses I just suck at it lol.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/ueb255\/instant_rebate_issues_customer_service_hates_me\/","reddit_title":"Instant rebate issues - customer service hates me?","reddit_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/ueb255\/instant_rebate_issues_customer_service_hates_me\/","reddit_subreddit":"BestBuyWorkers","reddit_link_id":null,"reddit_parent_id":null,"reddit_submission":null},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2022-04-29T19:10:59","reddit_id":"i6q5qtu","reddit_name":"t1_i6q5qtu","reddit_created_utc":1651273859,"reddit_author":"ActNormal9142","reddit_text":"A store is not going to assist you with a online order.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/ueb255\/instant_rebate_issues_customer_service_hates_me\/i6q5qtu\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"BestBuyWorkers","reddit_link_id":"t3_ueb255","reddit_parent_id":"t3_ueb255","reddit_submission":"ueb255"},{"aware_post_type":"submission","aware_created_ts":"2022-04-27T16:27:03","reddit_id":"udczwq","reddit_name":"t3_udczwq","reddit_created_utc":1651091223,"reddit_author":"MercWorks","reddit_text":"","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/udczwq\/went_to_best_buy_on_sunday\/","reddit_title":"Went to Best Buy on Sunday","reddit_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/gallery\/udcxmt","reddit_subreddit":"BestBuyWorkers","reddit_link_id":null,"reddit_parent_id":null,"reddit_submission":null},{"aware_post_type":"submission","aware_created_ts":"2022-04-22T21:42:45","reddit_id":"u9ubpe","reddit_name":"t3_u9ubpe","reddit_created_utc":1650678165,"reddit_author":"BuyBABA","reddit_text":"What is the starting wage for a part-time sales advisor?\n\nI've seen $12 an hour but I've also read articles about a $15 minimum online and I've seen some posts in here.

I rerouted a purchase to Best Buy in December to get me over the line for the next year.\n\nI also managed to get a nice video card from Best Buy at MSRP last year because they did a nice job with the anti-bot tech - and didn't give in to raising prices beyond MSRP like for example newegg.

Next round of video cards were only made available to those who paid for Best Buy's Total Tech.

Remodel ran long so the TV sat safely in its box upstairs in an office. When the remodel finally finished early this month, I brought the TV down and unboxed it and turned it on just to find that the display was either defective or cracked. It looks like it took a bit of a hit before being boxed.   \n\n\nI have heard that this is not all that uncommon and that BestBuy or Samsung with generally take them back, but only during the 30 day exchange period. Since I was unaware of the fault (as I waited for the basement to be ready for the TV), I am quite a bit out of that 30 day period.   \n\n\nTV was purchased from BestBuy, but they are saying they can do nothing to help me. It has been more than 30 days, and they say anything after that falls under Samsung's window.   \n\n\nSamsung says that it is \"clearly accidental damage\" when I show them photos. I guess I understand where they may be coming from, but the TV has safely been in a box for the last few months. There was no damage to the box. They just say that I am lying.   \n\n\nIt was purchased on Amex, but they seem to only give me extended protection for 60 days.

Earlier today I did a price match on a Mr. Coffee frappe machine. A customer wanted me to price match the one from Walmart. The one we sold was 109.99 while the one on Walmarts website was 99.00. I double checked by typing in the model number into Google to see if it would bring it up, and it did. I thought I read the numbers right and went ahead and price matched it. \n\nThe make, the color, that was the same. \n\nJust found out the model number was NOT the same as I initially thought. \n\nThe model I sold her was 2149282. \n\nThe model I price matched was 2142925. \n\nIt was a major oversight on my part because I thought they were the same when I also looked it up in Walmarts online app. And I did it again but now it's saying it can't be found! I heard a horror story how Best BUY priced matched some premium appliances and as a result the company couldn't sell the appliances for years! \n\nAnd a manager did approve of this he took me for my word! And now I feel like shit! Is he going to get in trouble because of me?! What should I do? I really don't wanna be the reason we can't sell Mr. Coffee stuff anymore! And I really don't want that manager to lose his job because of my dumbass mistake! If I lose my job I deserve it but I don't wanna be responsible for someone else losing their job over my dumb mistake! \n\nI'm wanting to inform the managers tomorrow but what else should I do?

So don't you dare ask for time off. But watch the GM's come and go as they please, working \"half days\" or pretending they showed up at 6am to leave at 2pm on a Saturday, or scheduling full weeks \"working from home\". \n\nCustomers get to treat you like shit. They yell and cuss at you and Best Buy will just allow it. Better thicken up that skin before your shift. \n\nWant a regular schedule so you can plan your life? HA! Your schedule will NEVER be the same week to week (except to know you work at least 6 days a week). If you are lucky enough to get 2 days off, they're split. And your shifts will look something like; 10am-8pm, 11am- 10pm. I'd love someone to genuinely explain how you have a life with those kinds of shifts 6 days a week. You will never have a weekend day off ever again. \n\nBottom line, Best Buy exhibits behavior that their employees are expendable and replaceable.

Probably because they realized during 2020 they could make more money moving their platform online. \n\nSo if you hate yourself and want to be surrounded by a culture that hates you too, Best Buy is the place to be.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/qty7j8\/best_buy_doesnt_care_about_employees\/","reddit_title":"Best Buy Doesn't Care About Employees","reddit_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/qty7j8\/best_buy_doesnt_care_about_employees\/","reddit_subreddit":"BestBuyWorkers","reddit_link_id":null,"reddit_parent_id":null,"reddit_submission":null},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2021-11-15T02:03:42","reddit_id":"hkoz9g6","reddit_name":"t1_hkoz9g6","reddit_created_utc":1636959822,"reddit_author":"tenemele","reddit_text":"I'm so glad I left after my first 6 hours of \"training.\"","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/qty7j8\/best_buy_doesnt_care_about_employees\/hkoz9g6\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"BestBuyWorkers","reddit_link_id":"t3_qty7j8","reddit_parent_id":"t3_qty7j8","reddit_submission":"qty7j8"},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2021-11-15T06:00:42","reddit_id":"hkpgev8","reddit_name":"t1_hkpgev8","reddit_created_utc":1636974042,"reddit_author":"texasboiz98","reddit_text":"I would like to start an around of applause for this forreal!!!

It was a soft place to land when I left my long term degree field career to follow my dream of being a highschool history teacher.  The promise of fair wages,  annual increases,  tuition reimbursement,  and flexible hours was a dream.  Though I had to scrimp and scrape to make that dream work.  I started at $10\/hr part time,  and with hard work and great numbers for a noob was given the first available full time spot and moved to $10.50 roughly four months later, and eventually $10.95 at my one year with \"Rockstar\" across the board. I respected my managers and still do, they're great and genuine leaders. I think of my best buy Co workers as some of my closest friends and even family, while also brining friends on with the promise of a fair place to work as long as you're willing to do your job and learn new things while helping others \"discover what's possible\". When covid hit, there was no question in my mind that bestbuy was taking care of me, So, I would risk it and stay on curbside with only 7 other employees, and a couple managers in my store, deciding to not furlough. I had class, dealt with covid and was the best employee I could be for one of the best companies I had worked for. Finally, after covid we were all given increases to $15\/hr starting wage. When people were staring to be let go because of the wage increase, I started looking for opportunities elsewhere. I quickly found a better paying job, plus commission at a spectrum retail location closer to home. Because I respect and care what my GM and ASM think, I went to them and asked them if I were in a position where it may come to down to having to choose between me and another employee to let me know, because I had another opportunity, though I didn't want to leave what I considered a home away from home. I was assured my job was never in question and a few days later was told I would be getting an increase of .50 cents that corporate had authorized GMs to give to employees that had deserved more than the $15\/hr bump. Which, I really appreciated the recognition from my GM. My 3 year mark just hit in September and I was expecting the 3 percent increase that the people hired in at $15\/hr received when we first opened back after the shut down. Two cheques passed and nothing. So, I called HR. Where they started treating me like I was stupid, the lady tried to tell me my .50 cent increase that I've had for almost a year was my 3 percent. I \"kindly\" gave her a math lesson, that 3 percent of 15 is .47 and that I should have that on top of the .50 cents my GM gave me with the general increase. After telling the lady she could stop lying and should just tell me if I was getting the increase or not, she finally said because I went from $10.95\/hr to $15\/hr they were considering that my yearly increase and would not be seeing the three percent promised to every employee by Corey in our email about the $15 minimum. Well, turns out that if you started at $15, you do get the 3 percent. Allowing employees that have only been with the company for a year to make more than those that had been here for years. Me being lucky am .03 cents ahead of the noobs in my store, but there are others that started around the same time I did, still only making $15 at their three year. While mediocre, and even under performing 1 year associates, unwilling to lift anything heavier than a toaster or try to sell enablers are making more. I made million dollar club the same month I hit three years. looking at that and then 700 plus branded payments and 600 plus TTS, I've peddaled to my clients, I feel like I've been slapped in the face by a company that I had decided to stick with, because I felt I was appreciated and valued. Seeing that they value every year I've spent here as .01 cent higher per year than what they value someone who's been here for a year, or gone from part time to full-time. \n\nI guess my question is, are there any other long time employees that feel completely betrayed by the company? Not only betrayed, but lied to in being told and made to feel like you matter, only to find out that you don't? \n\nI'm really questioning whether I should stay with the company. My GM had me do the lead e-learn so I can key hold during the holiday to get an extra bump in pay, but why should I have to take on extra responsibility to make what others would make without having to take on those responsibility, simply because I've been here longer? \n\nDoes this seem insane to anyone else, or am I upset about nothing?","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/qso748\/pre_15hr_increase_workers_denied_3_percent_raise\/","reddit_title":"Pre $15\/hr increase workers denied 3 percent raise.

My reasons were compounded by favoritism and sexual harassment. Note** MDC was 100% commission based. You could make ALOT of money if you\u2019re a closer (I am, was one of the top network designers in the country)\n\nBest Buy recently made the largest restructuring they\u2019ve had in over a decade. This roll out was through the pandemic and VERY ROUGH. \n\nThey went from hourly, specialized departments to hourly+commission store wide sales consultants. Meaning the sales people had to step out of their \u201ccomfort zone\u201d and learn other parts of the store they were not familiar with. This new business model included in-home \u201cSr. Sales Consultants\u201d that would advise customers in their homes. On paper and in theory this is a smart move. A personal touch higher paid sales people that are more knowledgeable. \n\nThe problem with that is there are only a few guys skilled enough to do these roles and worked mainly on the MDC department along with a handful of Best Buy \u201cIn home advisors\u201d which were just more entry-level system designers. When they rolled everything out they stripped the majority system designers of their titles, made them focus on lesser products and learn the entire store. And high end or high level jobs would go to the 1 or 2 designers that would then take on everyone\u2019s workload. \n\nIt was stressful as hell\nIt was demoralizing being stripped of a prestigious title.\nIt made us feel like a number in a machine\n\nI personally was offered a pay cut and they tried to make me feel excited about it. (Most got raises, more on that later.) THEN MADE ME WORK MORE! The rest of the store basically got pay raises and demoted. It\u2019s what it felt like. Payed more to eat more shit.\n\nThey stopped caring about the things that made the work place fun and focused heavily on subscription based services (TTS) and coached primarily on that. And getting credit cards. The important managers (GM\/SSM) are rarely in the store to address concerns and the company has them hide behind a computer all day doing other things.\n\nThey are turning more stores into just warehouses, the staff is trained to hand the customer off to a sales consultant or sr sales consultant. So it makes the worker feel less important. A lot of people are taking pay cuts to leave. In my store alone I can name 6 off the top of my head and more looking for other work. ALL of which where the best employees in the store. \n\nMy store went from 7 to 2 designers. One of which was a \u201cstraight\u201d man who asked me to have sex with his wife while he watched. Turns out he\u2019s also both gay and straight. He\u2019s had multiple sexual harassment accusations. Our store had a new GM take our store over and right before the switch. This GM had known the gay cuck for \u201cyears\u201d Turns out he\u2019s doing the interviews. Again, I was one of the top networking designers in the country, but he sold more TVs and sound-bars than me. I made the company more money, he sold more entry level product. \n\nThey promoted the gay cuck\n\nTry to get me to hand my clients over to him. \nMy clients were CEOs, Lawyers, Real-estate investors. They were loyal to me. Repeat clients \n\nHis customer was a kid who\u2019s parents own a small phone repair store that bought brackets and entry level TVs from him. \n\nBest Buy is a who you know - blunt force object that pushed all their skilled workers out because they think they don\u2019t need them. The majority of their money comes from online purchases. \n\nI used to like working there and my experience alllll the way up until the end was mostly positive.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/qpi3rj\/really_need_this_job_just_received_the_text_to_do\/hudxu80\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"BestBuyWorkers","reddit_link_id":"t3_qpi3rj","reddit_parent_id":"t1_huddqx5","reddit_submission":"qpi3rj"},{"aware_post_type":"submission","aware_created_ts":"2021-11-07T21:50:40","reddit_id":"qp4czc","reddit_name":"t3_qp4czc","reddit_created_utc":1636339840,"reddit_author":"Illustrious-Tiger-98","reddit_text":"I am a part time employee who struggles with doing what I need to do to perform and having integrity.

I want to get one rolling for this holiday season. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFolks, best buy can't hire much more than teenagers and is hemorrhaging labour to places willing to pay more. They don't value us, but they NEED us. They need us for picks. They need us for sales floor. They need us for scheduling and consultation. Our leadership in store cannot help us, they're forced to further exploit us with pressure from corporate. They're forced to rely on us breaking SOP to get jobs done. We're pressured to sacrifice physical and mental well-being for them to scrape whatever extra change they can from our efforts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe are all sick of the current situation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis holiday season is OUR chance. No more masturbatory claims of being the \"hardest worker,\" no more praying for a fifty cent raise with thrice the responsibility, or getting choked up over an extra dollar an hour with a keyholder position and all of the ridiculous extra responsibilities they want to shove to us from their workload because leadership itself is now understaffed. We've all had it, from front end to the ARAs to mobile to product flow. We just need enough people at enough stores to blackout their profits. They can ignore one store stuttering. They can ignore a store in every region stuttering, but they can't ignore entire service districts going out at once. They can't ignore walkouts during the holiday season. They cannot afford to lose more of us, and to your coworkers that aren't sure where they stand, do they want to be the ones left with the extra workload when we walk out? Do they want to carry the load that corporate will carelessly force on them, demanding their sweat and blood for dimes?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you see your team walk out, you walk with them, either in solidarity, or to avoid further exploitation. You must screen yourself from the potential damage, leave with them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo the leadership out there that read this, from hourly supes to Operations to GMs, when we're all gone, corporate will put it on you. You're just as expendable as the rest of us. Salaried leadership might feel separate, but you're just as exploited. You deserve better, too. We all do.\n\nCorporate tells us to be human? Well, how have humans survived so long? We extinguished our predators. We adapted, and then we made the environment adapt to us. We've long since passed our limit, it's time to make corporate adapt to us, and show them just how human we are.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope the message is clear, and my coworkers do not fail to understand the tools we are provided this holiday season.

Our store had people lined up the day before, and from what my management said the people who got there after 3 AM were the ones who didn't get tickets, only those who were there before did.

That would be your fifth reason for the dip in applicants. \n\nI also found this quote hilarious: \"*it's about a wholesome set of benefits that we can put in place*\"\n\nReally? What benefits do PT workers get? No medical\/dental\/vision, no PTO to speak of (but routinely near full-time hours). I guess they can buy BBY stock at a discount in the ESPP program? Wheeeeee. \n\nAnd when you say \"and flexibility that we can put in place\" it rings more like you want to cut people from 39 hours to 4 hours with little notice, but also want them to come in on their scheduled days off on short notice too. How does this benefit the customer Corie? What is your endgame here? Because customers are likely going to hate having even less experienced employees to have answer their questions, which is what you lost when you cut 5K full timers loose.\n\nEdit: link description changed to CNN article title","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/nq49o1\/cnn_corie_barry_interview_even_as_sales_are\/","reddit_title":"CNN Corie Barry interview \"[e]ven as sales are ramping up, Best Buy is seeing a dip in job applications\"","reddit_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/nq49o1\/cnn_corie_barry_interview_even_as_sales_are\/","reddit_subreddit":"BestBuyWorkers","reddit_link_id":null,"reddit_parent_id":null,"reddit_submission":null},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2021-06-01T22:37:36","reddit_id":"h09oatx","reddit_name":"t1_h09oatx","reddit_created_utc":1622601456,"reddit_author":"maurigr31","reddit_text":"How do we make her see this?

I was \u201cexpected\u201d to perform the same without any incentive which seemed stupid but that\u2019s a different story. Opportunity and growth within the company soon became stagnant and I began looking for a different job that I soon found thankfully. Anyways Best Buy was an awesome opportunity for me to get introduced into retail but I no longer seem to have my energy placed there. I wish you all cheers and prosperity alongside with growth in life. Stay safe y\u2019all.

I worked a steady schedule for 2 weeks, but nobody told me what to do. My co-workers had to help me get my start because management just completely forgot about me. Little did I know, the day I finished my E-Learning and got my blue shirt would be my last day there\n   I had worked about 8 days up until this point. As mentioned before, this would be the end. The next 2 weeks I had 0 hours scheduled. I had to come in and ask about it because nobody was returning my emails. My hiring manager told me they were cutting hours and things would be back to normal\n   2 more weeks passed and I still had not been scheduled, and had been informed after emailing my manager that the hour cuts were extended.\n   Black friday rolled around and I emailed asking if they needed me for black friday. At this point, I still had not been scheduled and nobody was returning my emails at all. About 2 weeks after black friday I came into the location because I was unable to log into the best buy app. I had emailed about this several times with no response. It is then that I found out I had been fired without even being told. The guy who checked the database and found out I was fired had no clue why, he just saw that my info was no longer in the database. I finally got in contact with my manager around January and he said to apply back in March, when they would be hiring again.\n   I didn't go looking for another job since he assured me that he wanted me back and it wasn't suppose to be like this. I emailed again in February to make sure I was still clear to re apply. He said yes.\n   Then a week ago after 3 emails, he finally responded asking my age and hours. I said 17 (because my bday had passed) and told him my hours. He responded and said that they want people who can work multiple positions and use equipment, and to wait until I'm 18. \n   So I had just spent half a year of my life with no income, under the assurance that I would be back to work. And don't forget that I had been secretly laid off, without being told. Not even after contacting them several times. This completely fucked us on my dad's heart surgery after his stroke, and our bills.\n   This has been a god awful experience and my parents wish we had time and money to look into a lawsuit.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/mesrs0\/how_my_management_lied_to_and_scammed_me\/","reddit_title":"How my management lied to and scammed me.","reddit_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/mesrs0\/how_my_management_lied_to_and_scammed_me\/","reddit_subreddit":"BestBuyWorkers","reddit_link_id":null,"reddit_parent_id":null,"reddit_submission":null},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2021-03-28T01:29:39","reddit_id":"gsjzejv","reddit_name":"t1_gsjzejv","reddit_created_utc":1616909379,"reddit_author":"eID-","reddit_text":"Mehta state are you in?","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/mesrs0\/how_my_management_lied_to_and_scammed_me\/gsjzejv\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"BestBuyWorkers","reddit_link_id":"t3_mesrs0","reddit_parent_id":"t3_mesrs0","reddit_submission":"mesrs0"},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2021-03-28T14:01:47","reddit_id":"gsloa18","reddit_name":"t1_gsloa18","reddit_created_utc":1616954507,"reddit_author":"Evan_v21","reddit_text":"Get a lawyer, pay for the lawyers time with the settlement money.

This boot licking of just bending over and taking it that you advise isn't the way that things get better.  Using fear to keep people in line is toxic, demeaning, and unethical.  I refuse to let them keep doing myself and my co-workers so dirty.  All they have to do is \"be human\" and stop abusing us all.  It really isn't hard to just keep in mind that we are people that deserve respect.  They have done shockingly positive things for us workers even just 5 years ago.  So I know it can be done.  What they are doing now is causing burn outs and isn't sustainable given the ways they are cutting staff and effectively making full-timers the same as part-timers with regard to hours.  The way they are going is a great way to make quick money for the top, but will drop hard in the future.  When we are fired because of this, then I fail to see what is worth not doing something.  We will maybe get some small severances, while they will get multi-million dollar ones.  I am guessing that they are trying to somehow be acquired by Amazon with the drastic changes.  If we are being picked off, then we should be coming together and push back.  Believe it or not, I do like the company and want all of us to share in successes that can be had.

This job literally sounds like a perfect fit for me, and I\u2019ve been searching for months","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/k2a20b\/associate_product_manager_opening_help\/","reddit_title":"Associate Product Manager opening help?","reddit_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/k2a20b\/associate_product_manager_opening_help\/","reddit_subreddit":"BestBuyWorkers","reddit_link_id":null,"reddit_parent_id":null,"reddit_submission":null},{"aware_post_type":"submission","aware_created_ts":"2020-11-26T00:02:33","reddit_id":"k18u9o","reddit_name":"t3_k18u9o","reddit_created_utc":1606366953,"reddit_author":"positively_rhea","reddit_text":"Are you currently a service industry worker (e.g., barista, bartender, restaurant host or server, retail worker, transportation worker, hairdresser, nail technician, etc.) in the U.S. and 18 years or older?

Following a year after, I was sexually harassed by my supervisor in late 2019. After reporting that incident, my employment at Best Buy took the worst of turns.\n\nWhile the store as a whole could agree that my supervisor\u2019s overall behavior at work was questionable (just before being promoted as my supervisor, he had been documented for threatening to physically harm a customer.), his sales for the store were competitively high.\n\nMy former supervisor had the highest amount of Total Tech Support sales out of all the employees in the store, while his moods were not always pleasant, he was a crucial part of the team since he helped carry the store\u2019s revenue.\n\nDuring his short time as my supervisor, he crossed several boundaries which led to his termination. I do want to mention that during the process, the human resources representative assigned to my case during the investigation asked me a question which to this day, I cannot agree with.\n\n*\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say something sooner?\u201d*\n\nThis question does not feel sincere, but rather similar to an accusation. Talking about sexual harassment, sexual assault, rape, or any misconduct of that matter, is not an easy subject to open up about. Asking why a victim didn\u2019t rush to speak out feels like a shift of blame. I hope in the future, companies begin to ask more appropriate questions that are more productive to their investigation.\n\nMy personal take: Never question the victim\u2019s motives. If you are curious, here\u2019s the answer- we are attempting to cope with whatever trauma we were forced to face.\n\nAfter the termination of my supervisor, different managers began to share with me that the General Manager of the store was no longer fond of me. I was aware that his behavior towards me had changed. I think about the sexual harassment investigation, remembering my GM\u2019s reaction when he sat next to me during a conference call with human resources.\n\nI told the representative that I had shared with my coworkers the sexual harassment incidents that I had faced. I explained to the representative that I did not feel comfortable with the management at my store, which is why I never came to them. There had been a previous conflict that had occurred in my department which management had not handled professionally.\n\nWhen I shared this information with the representative, I watched my GM bury his face into the palms of his hands. My intention was never to embarrass the GM or the training of his staff, but to express to human resources why I didn\u2019t feel comfortable confiding in management.\n\nA few days after the termination of my supervisor, I had shared with my GM and the human resources team that I had a concern about an employee who is a family member of my former supervisor. He was a seasonal employee and was had a close relationship with my former supervisor, as they lived together and shared a car. During a casual conversation that I once had with him, he has shared with me that he had been in and out of jail for improper conduct regarding violent behavior.\n\nI shared that conversation with my GM and expressed to him my fear of physical harm or retaliation from this employee. My GM responded to me, \u201che is seasonal, which means we don\u2019t have to move forward with him. If I were you, I wouldn\u2019t worry about it.\u201d\n\nThis had given me peace of mind, until weeks later when I discovered that my GM kept him in the store with a promotion as a full-time employee.\n\nI had felt so deceived by my own General Manager and I no longer felt safe working at the store.\n\nThinking about the days that followed, my dynamic with my GM changed. He began ignoring me at work. It was very uncomfortable to go into work, walking past each other while making eye-contact, and there being no acknowledgment from him. During some instances, I would be the bigger person and say hello or good morning, but when I did, I was blatantly ignored.\n\nI changed my mindset and accepted that I would come into work to help clients and to stay out of my GM\u2019s way. There did come a point where I was overwhelmed by how often management was warning me about his growing dislike towards me.\n\nIn addition, some of the management would tell me that my GM would persistently ask about my performance. They were told that if I was caught doing something that came remotely close to violating policy, to report the incident to my GM immediately. While this is a fair request, asking management to overlook their staff, why was I being targeted specifically? This had made me feel as if my General Manager wanted to ensure that I was under scrutiny.\n\nI\u2019ve always been the person to hear bad news and to stay in a state of shock. I never questioned the management who\u2019d warned me about my GM. I always nodded my head and absorbed the information, never wanting to continue a conversation about how I was potentially in a hostile work environment. To talk about it, was to acknowledge that it existed.\n\nOne day, I developed the courage to ask a manager . . .\n\nMe: \u201cHey, do you know why it is that \\[my GM\\] doesn\u2019t like me?\u201d\n\nManager: \u201cDid you ever see \\[your former supervisor\\]\u2019s numbers?\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cI guess, but he wasn\u2019t a good employee, I thought?\u201d\n\nManager: \u201cRight, but you reported a problem that brought HR to fly in from out of state. That doesn\u2019t make \\[your GM\\] look good in front of HR.\u201d\n\nAfter that answer, I knew at that moment that this was never going to end; my General Manager would see it through to have me terminated.\n\nI received a disciplinary action form some weeks after my supervisor\u2019s termination: a final warning. An employee had come to the store on their day off wanting to exchange a product that had been at an ex-boyfriends house, she had finally been able to retrieve it and wanted to upgrade it to something of a higher quality. I considered that Best Buy\u2019s management always made exceptions outside of the return\/exchange policy for customer satisfaction (this exception is a case-by-case decision).\n\nConsidering how I was told to look at out-of-policy transactions (to make exceptions for customers who are willing to spend more money during the exchange process.), I asked a nearby manager if my coworker could exchange an item that was out of policy. After the manager had approved the transaction, I was pulled into the GM\u2019s office days later signing my first, final warning.\n\nI had pondered for days wondering if having a manager\u2019s approval still deemed the situation to be a violation of policy. My days of wondering ended soon after I was told that the write up was given solely to ensure that it was on my Best Buy employee record.\n\nOne of the managers shared with employees that the GM, being general manager, had the authority to choose the severity of the write-up. Managers shared with employees that my General Manager wanted to ensure that I was put on a final warning.\n\nI had a coworker call me after my shift that day, explaining that they felt that my write up was a form of retaliation. This was an employee who I had not shared any information about my investigation case or how I had been feeling ignored by my GM. However, before ending the call, the employee vowed to report their observations to Best Buy\u2019s human resources.\n\nI approached my GM the following week asking him to look into transferring me to another Best Buy location, but he never followed up with me as promised.\n\nMonths later, I called human resources to finally open up about my fear of retaliation from my General Manager. Human resources took note of my statement and opened a case, but they never reached out to me again after that phone call.\n\nIt would be wishful thinking to believe that this is all he-said, she-said, work nonsense. However, after having six different managers in the store confirm that my General Manager had it out for me, wishful thinking would be ignorance.\n\nI am currently a former Best Buy employee. I do wonder at times, maybe if I had stopped my coworkers from making that call to Best Buy\u2019s human resources department about my sexual harassment concern with my supervisor, I might still work for Best Buy. Perhaps I would\u2019ve had the opportunity to leave on a good note, with the option of having my general manager as a reference for any future work opportunities. But I\u2019ve come to accept that this isn\u2019t my reality. Best Buy is now a closed chapter of my life.\n\nMy purpose for this lengthy reflection is for people to know the truth. The journey to creating a positive work environment for victims who have reported sexual harassment has a long way to go. In a place where I once called my second home, it became the place where I was scared to go to work and where I didn\u2019t feel the support and acceptance from my management team.\n\nI do not discourage women or men that want to report harassment in the workplace, once it\u2019s seen through, it can be a sense of relief. However, I strongly urge people to know that in reporting these concerns, there are consequences that we must face. It is a challenging part of being a victim.\n\nI wish that no one ever has to face half of the battles that I have had to when it\u2019s come to sexual harassment in the workplace, but if you are faced with it, I hope that you choose wisely and do what is ultimately best for you.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/j5vbke\/retaliation_prevention_policy_a_former_employee\/","reddit_title":"Retaliation Prevention Policy: A Former Employee Story","reddit_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/j5vbke\/retaliation_prevention_policy_a_former_employee\/","reddit_subreddit":"BestBuyWorkers","reddit_link_id":null,"reddit_parent_id":null,"reddit_submission":null},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2020-10-06T19:28:19","reddit_id":"g7y7b64","reddit_name":"t1_g7y7b64","reddit_created_utc":1602026899,"reddit_author":"bbythrowaway8675309","reddit_text":"What an absolutely awful GM.

People being vague in their notes about what the appointment is about (had a customer that came in for a visit in car audio, that ended up adding on some mobile stuff which extended their visit to an hour).\n3. Apparently masks are optional for customers.\n4. And even though customers are supposed to be hands off, they're still touching things despite being told not to, and that makes the post visit clean up time consuming.\n\nI really wish we required masks though. No medical exceptions (because there aren't any which doctors have freely admitted). We also shouldn't schedule visits towards closing time (when curbside inevitably gets busier). Last appointment should be an hour before close (with the half hour visit ending a half hour before close).\n\nIt would also be nice if the scheduler provided a way to block off more time for customers that may need it (I guess you could double book someone to achieve the same effect though).","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/gin14r\/appointment_visits\/","reddit_title":"Appointment visits","reddit_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/gin14r\/appointment_visits\/","reddit_subreddit":"BestBuyWorkers","reddit_link_id":null,"reddit_parent_id":null,"reddit_submission":null},{"aware_post_type":"submission","aware_created_ts":"2020-05-07T16:38:49","reddit_id":"gfep79","reddit_name":"t3_gfep79","reddit_created_utc":1588883929,"reddit_author":"Forsaken-Example","reddit_text":"Has anyone gotten any context or valid info about when furloughed employees may be brought back?","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/gfep79\/furloughed\/","reddit_title":"Furloughed","reddit_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/gfep79\/furloughed\/","reddit_subreddit":"BestBuyWorkers","reddit_link_id":null,"reddit_parent_id":null,"reddit_submission":null},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2020-05-07T19:39:17","reddit_id":"fptntf7","reddit_name":"t1_fptntf7","reddit_created_utc":1588894757,"reddit_author":"TacticalSilverware","reddit_text":"I was told the end of May is the date that corperate is expecting to start bringing people back, but I highly doubt that.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/gfep79\/furloughed\/fptntf7\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"BestBuyWorkers","reddit_link_id":"t3_gfep79","reddit_parent_id":"t3_gfep79","reddit_submission":"gfep79"},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2020-05-08T15:57:51","reddit_id":"fpwq0u1","reddit_name":"t1_fpwq0u1","reddit_created_utc":1588967871,"reddit_author":"ApplesBestSlave","reddit_text":"I got the call yesterday to come back.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/gfep79\/furloughed\/fpwq0u1\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"BestBuyWorkers","reddit_link_id":"t3_gfep79","reddit_parent_id":"t3_gfep79","reddit_submission":"gfep79"},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2020-05-08T15:58:13","reddit_id":"fpwq2ev","reddit_name":"t1_fpwq2ev","reddit_created_utc":1588967893,"reddit_author":"ApplesBestSlave","reddit_text":"market HR manager and GM were on the call.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/gfep79\/furloughed\/fpwq2ev\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"BestBuyWorkers","reddit_link_id":"t3_gfep79","reddit_parent_id":"t3_gfep79","reddit_submission":"gfep79"},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2020-05-08T15:58:40","reddit_id":"fpwq4cw","reddit_name":"t1_fpwq4cw","reddit_created_utc":1588967920,"reddit_author":"ApplesBestSlave","reddit_text":"the 10th","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/gfep79\/furloughed\/fpwq4cw\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"BestBuyWorkers","reddit_link_id":"t3_gfep79","reddit_parent_id":"t3_gfep79","reddit_submission":"gfep79"},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2020-05-08T15:59:09","reddit_id":"fpwq6ei","reddit_name":"t1_fpwq6ei","reddit_created_utc":1588967949,"reddit_author":"Forsaken-Example","reddit_text":"Oh wow that\u2019s quick.

I've been saying this will happen for years and it is playing out exactly as predicted: Corie hamstrings the stores to drive away customers intentionally so she can close stores to save overhead, but the exaggerated numbers for online sales never materialize and things get worse overall: rinse repeat, and with every cycle Best Buy, gets weaker and smaller. Notice that the most dire company information in that video (and elsewhere) comes from Coire's own reports? That's no accident.

You are responsible for dragging a failing install bay out of the mud, and into success, like the bay you run now.\"\n\n\"Uh, no. I will not do that, I like having a short commute. But let's say I do agree, what are you offering me to do this? This is a LOT more work than I have now, and a much longer commute. Surely you plan to incentivise me somehow, right?\"\n\n\"No, you are at cap, we cannot offer you a raise. Ever, actually. The next time you are up for a raise, we will calculate how much money that would add to your annual pay, and give it to you in a lump sum. So, you will get nothing right now.\"\n\n\"Yeah, no. Like, HELL no. I am underpaid as it is. If you won't compensate me, and I have to commute anyway, then I will find someone who WILL compensate me. I'll have a new job in the next couole days, in fact. You do not realize how valuable I am. This is a really stupid move. Best Buy doesn't realize how lucky they are to have me as it is.\"\n\n\"Well, I can't stop you. We'd really like to have you at this other location, though, I think we could do great things there with you on board.\"\n\n\"Yup, seems like an amazing move... For Best Buy.

I will not work a single day there, just you watch.\"\n\nAnd so, within 12 hours, I had 9 offers from competitors. Most were out of state, but one was in the very town they wanted to send me to. That's where I work now. I never worked a single day in the bay they wanted me to go to, as promised. After 12 years of loyalty, this was how Best Buy decided to show their appreciation. My managers at my location were and are fantastic. They are why I stayed so long... But whoever made this decision is an absolute idiot. In the end, I thank them, though.

Use that store to teach yourself new skills, and grow as an installer. Then, when you've started to really get a handle on things, jump ship. Best Buy will not hesitate to screw you over, if you are in the way, so don't stay out of a false sense of loyalty, like I did. Use Best Buy to get a step up in life, and don't get stuck.

Shift leads can help open\/close the building, which allows \"name-tag\" leaders to work during customer hours. I used to have to spend 4-5 hours hosting and engagement leading, whereas now I can spread that time amongst the shift leads and use that time to coach and train.\n\nI also like that it is encouraging our employees to make decisions on \"basic\" MOD calls. So for example, does a supervisor or above really need to answer the \"Can I get an MOD to front lanes for a return question?\" When its for an opened product 3 days outside the return window. Like, y'all should know the policy, make a decision.\n\n\nHowever, I do have concerns that the company has lowered the threshold to obtain keys and alarm codes.\n\nThere's also a lot of mixed messaging around shift lead expectations. I just got off a teams call where our marketplace AVP warned us to stop calling shift lead a position, and to refer to it as a task. \"Our shift leads are not supervisors.\" And he's not wrong - it's not a job code. It's a task in TLC. But then he, our market HR, and my marketplace director (GM) turn around and list off all the things they want from our shift leads, and all of them sound very supervisory \n\nThis has caused tension amongst current shift leads. In the past, I was able to leverage the work I did as SWAT, for example, to get promoted. No one was paying me for the MOD calls I took as a non-leader.\nBut now we are paying them for their shift lead work. And we're paying them like shit for it.\nSo it's caused the issue where if we so much as ask \"hey can so and so shadow you today\" we get \"oh I'm not coded shift lead today so no.\"\n\nWe don't want to abuse their help - like, yes they should get paid for leadership tasking - but it does bring up a lot of questions about personal brand and how you are supposed to carry yourself.\n\nSo, still some stuff to figure out as a store in terms of how we execute this","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/14mdbfa\/shift_leads\/jq1vbzp\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"BestBuyWorkers","reddit_link_id":"t3_14mdbfa","reddit_parent_id":"t3_14mdbfa","reddit_submission":"14mdbfa"},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2023-06-29T20:14:37","reddit_id":"jq2e5ur","reddit_name":"t1_jq2e5ur","reddit_created_utc":1688084077,"reddit_author":"Accomplished_Cry4565","reddit_text":"For us, none of our 7 have gotten shift lead pay yet.

They are separate from Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics. Think of them more like sister companies. \n\nLG Display makes WOLED (also called WRGB, the emphasis is on the W meaning a white subpixel is added). Up until last year, that was the only panel available, and Sony (and others) used LGs panel in their OLEDs. \n\nLG Display's goal is to sell as many panels as possible, so they actually loved Sony and others buying their panels. When Sony started winning the King of TV Shootout over LG, they didn't care because it was still Display's panel. Of course LG Electronics wasn't happy about it \ud83d\ude1c.\n\nSamsung Electronics firmly supports QLED as the premier tech and NOT OLED (even the QD variety). They have been very vocal in their anti-OLED stance. But they are affected by changes to their sister company Samsung Display.\n\nSamsung Display used to make only LED panels. But LED panel production has slowly been shifting to China as Chinese companies can make them much cheaper. No one wants to buy a Chinese tv, but no one realizes where the panel in their tv comes from, so manufacturers are going to go with the cheapest panel available that performs to the required specs. \n\nThat means Samsung Display knew they had to get out of the LED panel business. Enter QD-OLED. They shifted to producing QD-OLED panels last year with really poor results to start. When they first were producing them, they had about a 30% yield (only 3 out of 10 panels survived the process). However, by the end of the year that number flipped to like 75% which was an incredible turnaround. \n\nSony saw the potential in QD-OLED and bought in almost immediately, which is very unlike Sony, who usually does not buy in on brand new technology. Samsung Electronics still wanted no part in OLEDs though, so they would not make a QD-OLED at first. Speculation here, but the thought is eventually the Samsung parent company stepped in and forced SSE to buy the panels from SSD or else SSD would have had difficulty not going under. \n\nWhile the QD panels were being developed, LG was working on the MLA panel. Completely different technology, but one that can get brightness equivalent to that of QD (although colors still aren't at the WD level).\n\nFor this year, the end result is LG will use LG Display's WOLED and MLA panels for their lineup. The 55, 65, and 77 G3 will use MLA, everything else will use the traditional WOLED panel (of which there are a couple of variations). This includes the 83\" G3 which will not be MLA (MLA panel not available in that size yet).\n\nSony will use the LG's WOLED in the A80L (all sizes), and Samsung's QD-OLED in the A95L.\n\nSamsung will use their QD-OLED panels in their S90C and S95C. They are also probably going to have a WOLED model later this year with an LG Display panel. \n\nQuick explanation of panels... OLED is inherently a dimmer technology, so it's all about getting the best color while maintaining brightness. Very simple explanation here, but WOLED uses a white subpixel, then filters it to make Red\/Green\/Blue light. This filtering process removes energy\/brightness from the light, so white light is then reintroduced to brighten the image. \n\nMLA uses tiny lenses to amplify the light and make it brighter, leading to a brighter picture and potentially less white light needed to brighten the picture. \n\nQD-OLED uses quantum dots, which rather than filter light actually transforms light to the color of the crystal used. The panel started with blue light (the strongest wavelength of R\/G\/B) and then either passes the blue light straight through or hits the Red or Green quantum crystal. The energy from the blue light activates the crystal which gives off its corresponding color. You get bright colors without introducing white. \n\nWOLEDs look great, but there is a slight whitewashing of colors (particularly reds). If that's all you've ever seen you would never even realize it. A QD-OLED makes much more vivid reds and can even produce shades or reds that have never been displayed on a tv before. When you watch demos on the A95 or S90\/95, pay attention to the reds. \n\nTheoretically the MLA should be able to do better colors too since the lenses allow less reliance on white light additions, but I've compared C3s to G3s and I honestly just don't see it.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/14odcg2\/settle_this_debate\/jqdngh8\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"BestBuyWorkers","reddit_link_id":"t3_14odcg2","reddit_parent_id":"t3_14odcg2","reddit_submission":"14odcg2"},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2023-07-02T01:02:20","reddit_id":"jqcipwj","reddit_name":"t1_jqcipwj","reddit_created_utc":1688274140,"reddit_author":"NotHelpfullTips","reddit_text":"Watchs videos from stop the fomo on YouTube.  \nI believe you can tell if you look at it under a magnifier device and see the difference between a woled (lg oled with white subpixel)   rumors are s90c is woled this year and the s95c is newer gen qdoled.

The idea is simply put as so - the micromarket would work like one big store (how SWAS was before) however resources are deployable from the Hub store (hence why Hub stores have the most headcount and generally the best of the best)... If a micromarket has 3 stores, picture those 3 stores as 1 big store - that's the idea behind the cuts and deployable labor from the hub store - in so many words, it's like a \"loyalty 1\" but to another store vs another department... From this perspective, you don't need 3 GSMs but 1 Services experience manager (the best GSM supposedly) to run this \"big store\" or MM and the other 2 GSMs would get cut... Evaluations were made based on personal ranking submitted to GM, GM rankings of leaders submitted to MM director (also the hub store GM but not really - they are like a DM of their MM but do have the Hub store as their home location) and then \"in partnership\" with AVP (Marketplace manager, more to come) and HR and 3rd party company (DEI\/ESG) - decisions were made on who would stay and who would leave... How those decisions were made were never explained to the individuals getting severance so that was essentially a mystery except to the parties involved in the decision making... Many stores were left in complete shock at who was retained and how the leaders were let go (basically, the leaders were scheduled to work and during their shift, they were given the scripted speech with their severance information, hopes of roles popping open soon in JOS, and being walk out the building without telling anyone what just happened and not being able to say bye to their teams). The main concern with the scheduled sit down severance speeches were to ensure that \"GMs got the store keys back to prevent having to rekey the buildings\" - as far as how the leader felt or having an opportunity to speak to anyone, that was placed at 0% priority or concern.\n\nThe Micromarket restructuring started about a year ago and I may have missed a few areas however, in general, this is pretty accurate. \n\nCorporate: many mergers and cuts occurred there as well, I don't have too many details as that was outside of my wheelhouse however, it was very impactful when I was informed.\n\nTerritory, Market, District: essentially all of those leaders and their staff were absorbed into a \"Marketplace\". A marketplace is like 3-4 districts from a legacy perspective (which was like 2 markets to go a little further) and managed by an AVP (assistant Vice President)... So obviously, there were a lot of cuts from the territory, market and district levels (many of those leaders saw the writing on the wall and left beforehand)... Many went the corporate route or multichannel\/unit route or home services route (as remote work was and still is overemphasized and overresourced however, still pretty safe in comparison to employees inside 4 walls) and then the rest were simply laid off... Many hundreds of years of tenure gone down the drain.\n\nField Agents: Essentially cut in half, this happened like a week ago around independence day.\n\nPrecinct: GSMs cut (there is one Services Experience manager per micromarket now in store and some stores have a services supervisor but not all). \n\nSales: all ASMs cut in half (with the exception of one Hub store per micromarket which may have 2-3 ASM - experience managers as they are called now, will be responsible and accountable for both Sales and Ops and will have a few weeks to learn the ropes). All SSMs cut whether appliances, connected, mobile, etc - they generally got absorbed into the Sup staffing headcount... Sups cut down to 2 or 3 maximum per store with 1 possibly being services supervisor for GSP (again, not every store had this Staffing Headcount - some stores got rid of GSM and the Senior is running the show in partnership with MM services experience manager). From sales, it's safe to say that at least 50% of the leaders were laid off (if you go from the furlough days of pandemic - you can say that 50% advisors have been cut since then as well although, this was not part of the micromarket op model) and what was replaced was a bucket of 40 hours per week per store of labor in leadership bucket for shift leads... If a store has 6 shift leads for example, each will get \"up to\" 7 hours of Shift lead pay per week - some more than others depending on how many managerial tasks\/duties they are assigned... Shift leads are essentially supposed to be your \"cream of the crop\" talent (although many stores were amateurishly handing out the position like candy on Halloween - how we used to do with backup VPLs in the past - and now are battling an uphill battle with the selections they made)... The way it should work is that SL get scheduled that labor \"activity\" (as it is not a Job Code per se but more of a skillset you schedule like you would a \"monthly training\" or \"new hire\") after being certified via elearnings and leadership approval in Learning Network... Those SLs should have been the best hourly line level employees and essentially were runner-up for Sup roles or what have you... The problem that is occurring in store now is that, there is a nudge coming from leadership that basically states the following \"a SL performs managerial duties when scheduled; a good SL performs managerial duties when needed; a great SL performs managerial duties at all times\" - the conflict arises when these SLs forget that they still have to contribute to store Performance and Look and Feel causing a \"power trip\" effect and fellow advisors getting upset at their high horse syndrome... Some more intelligent veteran SLs say, \"I will only perform key calls, overrides, MOD resolutions, etc while I'm being paid as SL\" because they are aware that there would be no promotional opportunity any time soon... This will by far be the greatest hurdle for the company as many of these veteran advisors working as SLs are not \"drinking the juice\" and feel that the company cut a plethora of leaders yet the job still remains to complete - end result, the SL must perform and\/or verify the task completion for lesser pay than previous Sups and without the name tag title to go along with... Obviously, this causes conflicts among advisors who are not SLs as jealousy or envy or even misunderstanding of the SL role causes internal discomfort and conflicts.\n\nProduct flow: essentially now a team which are led by shift leads (on a daily basis however, the EM for each store in partnership with GM and MM director could make a Sup in charge of Ops but not company directive). The traditional daily tasks, Merch, plano, Swat, Truck, etc are all merged into a bucket of labor now - there isn't a direct leader in the warehouse per se simply some SLs unless a MM decides to use a Sup for Ops (highly unlikely yet, some do have a process or Specialty Coach that may be utilized for \"setting direction\" in the MM)... As in the sales floor dilemmas, PF probably has much more as things like Truck night are being led by an able bodied advisor yet, they may back off the actual physical labor and \"manage\" the truck team the whole night... The \"too many chiefs, not enough Indians\" conflict arises (just as it does on the Sales floor) and many of the SLs have slim to no experience in actual people leading to diffuse the conflicts and create reasonable solutions... Again, the greatest issue will be getting the SL program under control as many may confuse the job activity with the job title and feel empowered to believe they are no longer required to roll their sleeves up and work.\n\nOutcome - apparently, NY micromarket stated that it took quite some time to get it figured out but that they love it now... I can say this was said to me by a few GMs when I was doing training with them (they kept winning on many of the scorecards at the time and it sparked my curiosity)... Turnover is expected of course and as cold as that may seem, it's actually calculated and even taken into account with salary compensation for those employees moving forward.\n\nMany are not in favor and feel that these changes and restructurings are occurring so quickly that uncertainty and employee morale are at an all time low... These changes including the changes that occurred with Total Tech (TTS, TT, MBBYTotal, etc) are all signs of amateur leadership from the top or signs of potential financial distress - definitely not well organized or thorough... That would probably be the most accurate assumption today and most employees would leave the company given the opportunity to as they feel the company no longer has its original core values and employee experience at heart... Some feel empowered and some have enthusiasm as they feel that many of the tenured leaders leaving will open up doors for their careers... Who's right? Only time will tell.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/153ukht\/restructuring_to_micromarket\/","reddit_title":"Restructuring to Micromarket","reddit_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/153ukht\/restructuring_to_micromarket\/","reddit_subreddit":"BestBuyWorkers","reddit_link_id":null,"reddit_parent_id":null,"reddit_submission":null},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2023-07-19T10:22:37","reddit_id":"jsld7vt","reddit_name":"t1_jsld7vt","reddit_created_utc":1689776557,"reddit_author":"rey268","reddit_text":"I appreciate this, it provides insight on the model the company ran with.

They used to all be weighted a third but I believe it\u2019s like 40\/40\/20 now.\n\nMemberships are profitable and help with OI, but there is no bonuses for hitting membership goals. Bad leaders don\u2019t explain the WHY of membership.\n\nThe strategy is that with the card it gives them more buying power to get all the services and accessories (Rev and OI) and with Plus and Total is incentivized repeat business. (Which is why you should be hearing about relational customers vs transactional customers in your coaching)\n\nBut there has never been a bonus for memberships but memberships are the leading indicator of hitting Rev and OI.\n\nShared success is a mystery metric though.

Asking questions like \u201cdo you shop here a lot?\u201d And \u201cdo you usually buy warranties on your devices?\u201d is a great way to break the ice on getting into the membership conversation. Me personally I like to find a specific item they\u2019re looking for before getting into any of that talk and I\u2019ll give you a example. Greet customer , pull up their account. \u201cHey David I see you\u2019re not a cardholder or member with us , just to let you know all of our laptops currently are 0% interest for 12 months if you wanted to take advantage of that, we also do have some great membership benefits but I\u2019ll get into that a little more later\u201d. You find laptop they want. \u201cGreat choice, I do have a couple more questions, do you plan on buying a protection plan for this laptop?\u201d Are you going to be needing a data transfer from your old device to this new one?\u201d If they answer yes to those you should SHOW them the $179 membership, we are visual beings, SHOW them the savings , \u201cI did briefly mention about membership benefits and I do believe our $179 membership is going to be fantastic for you, along with included protection up to 2 years on this device and majority of other items you buy all of our in store services are free meaning we can transfer your data to your new device for free, how does that sound?\u201d  If they yes great! Briefly go over the extra benefits like 60 day return policy and member pricing . If they aren\u2019t interested that\u2019s where you ask them if they shop here a lot, and SHOW them our member deals in the app or ssk(when it works ha ha). If they seem interested that\u2019s where you mention the $49.99 membership . In general if I can find a laptop\/tv on a membership price that fits the specs and needs of the customer I tend to bring them to that specific sku first because if they aren\u2019t interested in total it\u2019s much easier to transition into plus because most of the time that member price pays for the membership on the initial purchase.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/159fm06\/how_are_you_guys_pitching_the_new_my_best_buy\/jtf1u6q\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"BestBuyWorkers","reddit_link_id":"t3_159fm06","reddit_parent_id":"t3_159fm06","reddit_submission":"159fm06"},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2023-07-25T14:25:33","reddit_id":"jtf1a19","reddit_name":"t1_jtf1a19","reddit_created_utc":1690309533,"reddit_author":"MegaDonX","reddit_text":"This is the way.

If it's a question relating to a transaction between you and Best Buy, you should contact Best Buy USA at 1-888-BEST-BUY (or on the web at [https:\/\/www.bestbuy.com\/](https:\/\/www.bestbuy.com\/)).

I was a Home Theater Agent that did repairs on TVs. The number one TV I hated going out to fix was Sony. Especially if we had to deal with the factory warranty and put up with their bullshit. We would do a triage, and that wouldn't fix the TV all the time. Then, they would send part after part  until it was past 30 days or if the cost was BER (Beyond Economical Repair) on their end. Before I left, a poor elderly client was still waiting to get his Sony tv replaced after almost 3 months of multiple agents trying to fix it, but Sony wouldn't replace it. Sony's are great when they work, but after having to deal with them for 5 years on repairs and the headaches they have given us and clients. I refuse to buy a Sony TV. I would rather buy myself an LG OLED any day. It is much easier to deal with and easy to fix. I also didn't have to repair a lot of them. Samsung, I did repair the most, but those repairs are not a problem at all. They were the easiest to repair, but like I said, they do get serviced a lot. If you're going to get a Sony, then get the GSP plan. The process through the Geek Squad was simpler than the factory warranty but still a pain in the ass to fix. Sorry for the paragraph. I can say a lot more, but I bet no one is reading this far.\n\nTL:DR - Sony is a pain in the ass to deal with for this repair agent.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/15qii74\/best_tv_brand\/jw3qxul\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"BestBuyWorkers","reddit_link_id":"t3_15qii74","reddit_parent_id":"t3_15qii74","reddit_submission":"15qii74"},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2023-08-13T23:13:14","reddit_id":"jw3u13q","reddit_name":"t1_jw3u13q","reddit_created_utc":1691993594,"reddit_author":"yupification","reddit_text":"Sony overall but LG for OLED.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/15qii74\/best_tv_brand\/jw3u13q\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"BestBuyWorkers","reddit_link_id":"t3_15qii74","reddit_parent_id":"t3_15qii74","reddit_submission":"15qii74"},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2023-08-13T23:28:47","reddit_id":"jw3vawq","reddit_name":"t1_jw3vawq","reddit_created_utc":1691994527,"reddit_author":"vigilant007","reddit_text":"For me, TVs are great and all, but i can\u2019t see myself over paying for something I\u2019d want to fill my entire house with.\n\nThe best bang for the buck for me is Vizio\u2019s M and P line.

Lg makes a great OLED and some nice LEDs but I think Samsung and Sony fair better on the LED side of things. Even their flagship the qned85 is nice, I think most of our customers would be quite happy with the picture quality. But Samsung and Sony LED's are just more impressive to me. Even if you set all 3 to their respective filmmaker mode. Samsung has a lot of brand loyalty in my area and we do capitalize. Hell I got Samsung's. I've heard they have more failure's and seeing how many people complain is kinda how we would know about a failure rate. But I've also seen LG and Sony have failures pretty bad. If asked I'll tell them that, probably has a higher failure rate, but I don't think the risk differential is all that great. Definitely a compromise tv for me. But a pretty damn good one on the high end. But this year even their low end it pretty good. I think the cu7000 is actually a little impressive in the shadows and a decent brightness for a crystal uhd. Likewise from the x77l from Sony.  Lg uq series tv's look bland by comparison on the low end and their qned ain't quite as nice on the high end. Tcl and hisense came out swinging with the qm8 and u8 tv's but my store doesn't have those to display. Only the cheaper ones. Which still provide a good value for what they are but I know they would sell like crazy if people could see them.

A little research and you\u2019ll find it entirely depends on the customers wants and \u201cneeds\u201d. While Samsung makes the best brightroom TV, Hisense makes a wonderful midrange contender. LG dominates on the OLED side but not every category because LG has a wildly varying range of good, better, and best both Samsung and Sony have good contenders. Samsung has more service calls because they almost out sale at a 2 to 1 ratio over all the other brands. But if you look at percentages they are all pretty close to each other in terms of sales to service.  And if the customer is that concerned about needing a service call or wants more comprehensive coverage that\u2019s literally why Best Buy has the gold standard in warranty. Especially right now, because of such an aging market more often that not the older models have a better price to quality ratio that makes it hard to get a 2023 version of TV.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/15qii74\/best_tv_brand\/jw4q4lz\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"BestBuyWorkers","reddit_link_id":"t3_15qii74","reddit_parent_id":"t3_15qii74","reddit_submission":"15qii74"},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2023-08-14T06:03:58","reddit_id":"jw4utvf","reddit_name":"t1_jw4utvf","reddit_created_utc":1692018238,"reddit_author":"TheGreatUnknown30","reddit_text":"Dynex.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/15qii74\/best_tv_brand\/jw4utvf\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"BestBuyWorkers","reddit_link_id":"t3_15qii74","reddit_parent_id":"t3_15qii74","reddit_submission":"15qii74"},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2023-08-14T06:46:17","reddit_id":"jw50jjc","reddit_name":"t1_jw50jjc","reddit_created_utc":1692020777,"reddit_author":"Hfth20091000","reddit_text":"I have an LG in my bedroom and a Vizio in my living room.

But I'd say they are suitable for any room where blinds can be drawn. Ideal for darker spaces.  Sony prioritized accuracy of intent more in their image processing resulting in a sometimes less saturated and cool image than their competition, especially in a more vivid picture mode. You do still get reflections though, being able to see light fixtures and stuff . But you can't get rid of that without a matte display.  And that would suck for the contrast.

But as the company has evolved into a more lean operating model, (that doesn't match customer demand), stores have had to be creative in trying to bring the best experience to the customer.\n\nThe new job descriptions for most store positions have been updated to reflect this new mindset. For example here are a few excerpts from the current \nJob Description:\n\nThe Geek Squad Advanced Repair Agent identifies and offers technology related, solution-based recommendations to solve customer needs and ensure that no customer is left unserved. \n\nThey create and maintain a supportive environment for customers by asking the right questions, listening carefully, taking detailed notes and partnering with other team members. \n\nThey are passionate about technology and leverage their technical abilities to create positive customer interactions by solving a variety of software and hardware issues.\n\nAt Best Buy, we are obsessed with building long term relationships with our customers. Every team member should feel empowered to deliver a world-class and unique experience based on what each customer needs.\n\nKey Responsibilities\n- Helps drive a positive customer experience by building relationships, exhibiting empathy, and providing solutions for their needs.\n\nI mean it should not be any surprise by now that stores are doing whatever is necessary to try to meet the customer expectations. \n\nDo I agree?  Of course not!  I think the forecasters and labor teams have severely miscalculated the post-covid retail landscape, and lost sight of what made Best Buy great. That formula was simple, train great employees, promot a genuine customer experience and REAL having fun while being the best. That best buy is still there, just being suffocated.  Take my word with a grain of salt, because I've been out of the store since April, but until then I had high enough visibility to see all of this coming and most of my predictions have come to pass up until then. I have faith in all of the store teams and store leaders alike, if the company tanks it is not the fault of teams and leaders on the ground.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/15sx2rf\/can_i_be_forced_to_work_on_the_sales_floor_even\/jwgz6qm\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"BestBuyWorkers","reddit_link_id":"t3_15sx2rf","reddit_parent_id":"t3_15sx2rf","reddit_submission":"15sx2rf"},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2023-08-16T14:07:00","reddit_id":"jwhj3nd","reddit_name":"t1_jwhj3nd","reddit_created_utc":1692220020,"reddit_author":"materialisticgirl","reddit_text":"100% outside your job description.

That includes recently snapped managers that are now sales team, but still have to act as managers. \nAs an ARA myself with limited staff and a constant high demand (recently had over 30 items in repair), I push back against management as much as I can. It doesn\u2019t always work, but standing up for your clients is good ethics. Please pick your battles carefully though\u2026\nA few strategies are:\n - Offer to help briefly to answer questions or assist with a sale. Outright resistance is subordination, and will not be taken well. Work with them and they should work with you (though I know many managers are unreasonable\u2026). \n - Politely decline to be posted at an answer center. If no sales person is available, clients can work with a leader (who should be leading by example btw), or wait in queue like we do during the holidays. \n - Remind them that NPS may tank due to extended repair times. \n - Clients we have promised to work for take precedent over new clients. While we can\u2019t outright refuse to help someone without just reason, we should not be taking on more than we can handle, nor should we jump the queue. We work on an appointment based first-come first-serve basis, and take walk-ins as time permits.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/15sx2rf\/can_i_be_forced_to_work_on_the_sales_floor_even\/jwgtbtv\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"BestBuyWorkers","reddit_link_id":"t3_15sx2rf","reddit_parent_id":"t3_15sx2rf","reddit_submission":"15sx2rf"},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2023-08-16T15:47:44","reddit_id":"jwhz1nz","reddit_name":"t1_jwhz1nz","reddit_created_utc":1692226064,"reddit_author":"BeardedDrakken","reddit_text":"Check your job description SOP if it says you're not supposed to be on the floor the only thing you can do is contact hr.

You definitely are not alone, sometimes I just feel management gets crazy hate when they are usually getting the same throat shoving if not worse from district manage and up.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/15u9jff\/i_think_its_time_to_go\/jwodudo\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"BestBuyWorkers","reddit_link_id":"t3_15u9jff","reddit_parent_id":"t3_15u9jff","reddit_submission":"15u9jff"},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2023-08-18T00:10:27","reddit_id":"jwoe1yf","reddit_name":"t1_jwoe1yf","reddit_created_utc":1692331827,"reddit_author":"Putrid_Scale_6904","reddit_text":"I honestly think just grin and bare, or maybe hide out as product flow for a bit (million times less stress).

I was with BBY for 5 years.  Started as a sup, did some temp salary work, and finished as a GSM - snapped in June.  I wanted to provide a little perspective and share where I am today in hopes of helping those in similar circumstances or for the rest of you that have had enough. \n\nFirst, I\u2019d like to point out that I saw the snap coming, and was not surprised when I got the axe.  I saw the direction that the company was taking: less leadership, low\/no specialization of line levels, and more top-level influence on site.  With this in mind, severance was my desired outcome, and it was nice to get handed a check to not come back again. \n\nI\u2019m not rich, but am in a good position financially, so I committed to two things in my job search:\n\n1) I set up a system\/rhythm that I confirmed to daily. \n2) No applications for positions that paid less than what I was making when I exited BBY. \n3) No applications for something I wasn\u2019t interested in, regardless of pay. \n4) Try like hell to avoid retail.\n5) Apply to jobs not in my wheelhouse - look for a new path and emphasize transferable skills. \n6) Take my time and enjoy the extended vacation. \n\nI\u2019ve had a number of interviews since then, and what seems like 10x that number in rejections, but I wasn\u2019t deterred and stuck to my system.  I\u2019m starting a position next week that pays 15% more than my (capped) GSM pay.  In addition to a comparable benefit package, they also provide biannual reviews, guaranteed equity, and doesn\u2019t require a flexible schedule. They told me they\u2019d send me a laptop - assumed I\u2019d be getting a Chromebook from the pre-COVID era, but instead I got an M2 MacBook Air.  have a slightly larger team, but there are no customers, which is a benefit in and of itself.  Before I started looking, I didn\u2019t know this position existed, and while it\u2019s in the tech field, it\u2019s unlike anything I\u2019ve done before. \n\nThe point is that if you\u2019ve been laid off and you\u2019re still looking, or if you\u2019re looking for greener pastures, make sure you widen your approach. I don\u2019t agree with the direction that BBY is headed, but as far as retail is concerned, it\u2019s still an above average place to work.  You\u2019re not going to escape shitty customers or new initiatives or flavor of the month KPIs just because you switch polos.  If you hate working at BBY, you probably don\u2019t like retail. It takes courage to break away from the safety net that the retail industry provides - there\u2019s almost no barrier to entry to land a spot, jobs are always available, and the promise of \u201copportunity\u201d is always there.  In reality, and with some exceptions, the real opportunity is outside of retail.  Get creative, and leverage your skillset to land at a place that understands your potential. \n\nI always rooted for my employees at BBY, and I\u2019m rooting for all of you, too.

Our store was the Wild West. We hooked up an iPod to the store\u2019s speakers and would play music throughout the day and whoever got a Best Buy card, that associate could change the music station. (Pro tip: turning on Christmas music in July caused employees and customers to riot and complain to me to change it hahah)\n\nTwo employees got into a ball tag war where they\u2019d randomly try and hit each other in the nuts while working. It spread like wildfire throughout the store. \n\nAn employee poached someone else\u2019s sale that they had been working on for almost two hours that was $2k+. The employee who lost the sale walked by the poaching employee with a Game of Thrones box set and swung the box set up into the employee\u2019s ball sack and caused the employee to drop to the ground. The employee took over and got his original sale back while the customer was dying of laughter.\n\nIt all ended when an employee was hit in the balls with a pair of airpods while carrying a 30 lb printer down the ladder and fell off and broke the printer haha. HR came in and inquired with everyone and everyone protected each other and didnt say anything, but the GM, who was a G, admitted it happened and laid on the grenade for all of us and got probation. We took him out and bought him some beers afterwards.\n\nWhen the Force Awakens came out, there was a huge snow storm that effectively kept us from going  home so we all walked to the local movie theater where they gave us a special, free showing of Star WRs until the roads were plowed and salted.\n\nWe hooked up our phones to the bluetooth speaker demo products and would wait for the manager to walk through the department and contact customers in that section and then turn on a fart app and have the speaker loudly fart next to the manager haha.

I have been with my current Best Buy store since 2013. I have been through so many changes from departments to staff to memberships. Retail has always been described as a stepping stone job but the thing I loved about it was the customer experience. Helping people find what they need, not just what they think they want, solving the never ending problems in the electronics world and building bonds with customers. I have customers still to this day I've been helping since 2013. I've seen their kids grow up and seen some of them go off to college. I've learned a lot, grown a lot and tried to help those around me grow as well. I have gone through a lot with the company like cut backs, mass hiring, many holidays. I had an ASM Ramon who I could easily say was such a supportive and amazing person to guide paths for so many. 2018 I went through something that took a lot out of me mentally (my mom got really sick) and by 2019 she had left this world. Some of my Best Buy experience during this time was supportive. Being a person who had to take caregivers leave when it first released was a learning experience, asking for LOA when she went to hospice was disparaging when it was declined cause I didn't have the right paperwork, only to lose my mom before they approved it. Telling my GM I needed more time than the bereavement time allotted because I was going through a large amount of depression and anxiety and having him support me taking time. Making so many friends and watching them leave for school or other jobs. I was there for 24\/7, Total Tech Support, Total Tech to even the new plan. Rallying behind decisions that obviously I have no control over but hoping to inform customers the best way I can. The moral has been so down lately and it takes a toll on the brain. Constant red floors due to lack of staff, people leaving, the grind for memberships (which I don't mind but I do feel like since I deal with so many repeat customers what more can I do if they have already gotten the credit card from me or the TTS to TT and conversions). I love helping customers and getting to learn about their lives. I just feel run down. Everyone is mad about the changes and most will just tell me if you aren't happy leave. I may not be happy but I would miss the customers I see everyday that I have grown to know, the experience. Am I stressed, yes, did my department move on, yes, do I worry about the new people coming in, yes. Do I understand everyone's frustrations, yes, do I agree with a lot of them, yes, can I change it, no. All I can do is go day by day.

Getting tired of not doing something about it and the seemingly higher higher ups ups seemingly perfectly fine to let things stand. \n\nAlso, looking to see if any accountability can be had. Essentially if a cx comes in with erroneous information from 3pl, through recent interactions\/breeze you can see the case the rep made. If it's an actual bestbuy employee that made the case, it's easy to see the organization structure of that employee, so you can get their bosses information if something needs to be addressed, or you can message the employee directly through teams to coach out something real quick. This accountability doesn't exist for 3PL call centers. \n\nWhen I did work digital sales, there was a chicken guy that existed when transferring to another department (at the time I always transferred with the customer)\n\nIn that instance, I passed off the cx by having another rep reach out to them and I stayed on the line with the chicken guy. Nothing but roosters clucking. There wasn't an actual person on the line, just chickens. \n\nI stayed on that line for 4 hours, refusing to believe that digital sales leadership has zero ability to get chicken guy fired. Also stayed on the line cause if chicken guy was with me, then there wasn't any chance of another transfer. Also, it made their numbers look horrible so I hoped with the stone walling of leadership, at least maybe someone in the 3pl call center leadership would see the long call, listen in, and then hold chicken guy accountable. \n\nDidn't work though, swear chicken guy is still going strong as I have heard a cx or two cone in and say all they got were chickens on the line when needing help.\n\nAnyways, at the time, I spent a good amount of my shift trying to find some more detailed information about our 3pl call centers to maybe, hopefully get a good contact number. Digital sales leadership at the time refused to give any info, didn't care, or just remained willfully ignorant of the issue. \n\nI did find some documents with names. I think there were 3 names I found for different regions.\n\nToday, when I generally googled, I came across Sitel (which is now called foundever) that I think bestbuy uses. SITEL sounds familiar. I haven't been at work since I've been on vacation so I don't have access ATM to research internally. \n\nJust doing some musing while I relax, looking for avenues to take my existing knowledge of bestbuy and use it as leverage to maybe get hired on at a 3pl company that offers call center services to bestbuy. But that's the reason.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/162jj9o\/name_of_companys_running_3rd_party_call_centers\/jxzg7mq\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"BestBuyWorkers","reddit_link_id":"t3_162jj9o","reddit_parent_id":"t1_jxzbi4t","reddit_submission":"162jj9o"},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2023-08-27T07:42:42","reddit_id":"jxy39ng","reddit_name":"t1_jxy39ng","reddit_created_utc":1693136562,"reddit_author":"carmachu","reddit_text":"Ahhh the good old helpless desk.

In fact, they have an enormous turn over rate which is actually a problem. \n\nThat leads my to my other point. If you want to really help, joining a 3pl company isn't the answer in my opinion. Even if you did and even if it was a training or QA role, you still may make a relatively small but positive move. If you really want to change that world, you need to move up through BBCC leadership. Usually a Sr. Analyst owns the relationship of a 3pl team, so that may be a good place to look into.\n\nNext steps up (Associate Manager, Manager, Sr. Manager) you would have conversations with the 3pl Sr. Leadership, work with and own contracts, negotiate new teams etc.. then I'd say you can make a substantial impact. \n\nAs for chicken guy, if you get that information to the right team with the time you called and the number you called from, the leaders can absolutely pull the call. That said, 1 occurrence doesn't typically end in terminating that employee.

But chicken guy is popular. I swear I recognized the chickens. \n\nBut, in browsing, around, I found a wonderful excell file with lots of names and contacts of 3pl and a good amount of their structure. At least from the view from bestbuy. It's an old by about a year and a half, but yea. \n\nI believe you in that you get the right email to the right person, you can get accountability.\n\nThe problem is the availability and knowledge to execute that path towards correcting 3P.\n\nThe lack of readily available info, seems very purposeful (which it likely is)\n\nWith how easy it is to find store information, then leadership information, etc of bestbuy grown employees, it really should be equally accessible for getting information and coaching to 3pl to fix issues. \n\nAlso,I'm looking for numbers. Bestbuy employee customer care is dwindling in favor of 3PL. I'm very curious what metrics leadership is using to justify this move. \n\nIf I had to guess. They are looking at heavily at call length and transfer and not much else. That's the only way 3pl can beat home grown CC. I know while I was in that world, when I got someone who had been ran through the call center transfer rodeo, I took as much time as needed to get the customer taken care of. Productivity on paper would be sacrificed, but a customer was taken care of. \n\nIf that gap in awareness or recognition that Home based BBCC are more likely to resolve the customers issues which usually means longer times on the phone with the customer, then that's a problem. And, imo, that's what the trend leads me to believe is happening. Some pencil pusher is just seeing black and white data and making calls off of that, or they have a leader who's even more disconnected from the actual problem making quick judgment calls. \n\nI'm seeing that level of leadership through ignorance from market level to store level, so it isn't much of a stretch to believe that's also what is driving decisions concerning home based CC reps and 3pl ones.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/162jj9o\/name_of_companys_running_3rd_party_call_centers\/jy1qloi\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"BestBuyWorkers","reddit_link_id":"t3_162jj9o","reddit_parent_id":"t1_jy1no4w","reddit_submission":"162jj9o"},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2023-08-28T00:05:04","reddit_id":"jy1ruc5","reddit_name":"t1_jy1ruc5","reddit_created_utc":1693195504,"reddit_author":"LastKnownUser","reddit_text":"Oh and do want to say, I really appreciate the recommended roles.

That means a group of people have been fighting for you for months, if not a year. Other roles were eliminated and yours got a pay increase, so congrats?\n\nAnother point.. if you're in the mid band, new hires are typically brought on at the low band. I say this because I have been in your position and when my pay grade was adjusted I was moved to the very bottom of the new grade. Anyone hired was almost assuredly making more than me even though I had years of experience in the role. In those cases, you can have a conversation with you manager on what you're worth. There is a compensation e-learning that also outlines what each band is for, so that could help your case.

Now, normally I would not worry about this but due to unforeseen circumstances, I am put in a tight situation. You see, come November I have to leave the country to attend to some family matters overseas. This is something that I wasn't expecting and my family told me that I would be staying there for at least 3 months and now that I've just started working at the company I am not sure what to do. In fact, I start my first day on Sunday and I don't know how to approach my supervisor about this.\n\nThere are many questions going through my mind about this because I am really looking forward to starting work as I said earlier and I'm worried that I will be let go because of this inconvenience. I understand there are outside factors that are outside of my control but I really don't want this to spell doom to my newly appointed career at Best Buy because this is something that I've really been looking forward to as this is my first job. Do you think that I will be terminated or let go because of this? Will my supervisor be understanding of the situation that I am in? I know that the holiday season is right around the corner and I will have to leave just before the holiday rush I have a feeling that they will be rather annoyed that I will be doing this but again, it's outside my control.\n\nIf anyone is able to help provide insights with this please let me know!

I'm trying everyday to be a good employee but what is the point when corporate keeps killing off all the good positions? I'm not in college. I'm trying to move up in the company to make an actual living. But as the months have passed I've seen two shift lead positions and two supervisor positions get eliminated. So what the fuck is the point of spending my time here? I not only have to compete for a better position against everyone else but I also have to wait for one of my two remaining supervisors to leave the company. And if someone else gets that single open position I then have to wait another untold amount of time for someone else to leave. I'm ashamed of myself and I'm ashamed that I work here. It's embarrassing and honestly has been making me depressed. I can't wait to get a different job.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/16ha775\/waste_your_time_at_best_buy\/","reddit_title":"Waste your time at Best Buy","reddit_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/16ha775\/waste_your_time_at_best_buy\/","reddit_subreddit":"BestBuyWorkers","reddit_link_id":null,"reddit_parent_id":null,"reddit_submission":null},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2023-09-12T22:16:19","reddit_id":"k0cmnd6","reddit_name":"t1_k0cmnd6","reddit_created_utc":1694571379,"reddit_author":"_PlzBeGentle","reddit_text":"Ah as someone who heard the same thing, don\u2019t do it.

Traffic where I live normally takes me about 15-20 mins to get home. I clock out and head on my way. I get to the bridge that I have to cross in order to get from one city to another, and my tire completely gives out on me. Instead of taking my exit, I take the closer exit and there\u2019s an auto zone right off the exit. I ask to borrow the store jack, every auto zone has one, and the manager says no. One of the store attendants comes outside to help me jack my car up with a scissor jack, the shitty one my car came with, and my car ends up falling onto the rotor in which the tire was missing. I was infuriated. The store attendant tells me to buy the jack from inside and return it and if the manager says anything about it, to contact corporate. I do just that. Buy the jack, change my tire, return the jack. Manager tells me she can\u2019t return it because the store doesn\u2019t \u201crent\u201d out jacks. I say \u201cI didn\u2019t rent it. I bought it. I was unsatisfied. Now I want to return it.\u201d The guy who helped me, bless his heart, faked a phone call and was pretending to talk to a customer saying \u201cyes, we can return parts. The money will be sent back to your card within 2-3 days. Yes, even opened parts.\u201d Stuff like that. So she rips the receipt out of my hand, processed the return. I was standing there in my Best Buy blue shirt, and she says \u201cI know I won\u2019t be shopping at Best Buy anytime soon.\u201d I say, \u201cWe will not miss your business.\u201d The next day, I got the guy that helped me out, the store attendant, a $50 gift card to a local steakhouse. And with the remaining $50 I saved by returning the jack, the jack was $100 at auto zone, I bought the same jack off of FB Marketplace for $50. Just a very shitty customer experience overall from management, but a W auto zone attendant. I got home 5 mins before my draft was scheduled and drafted the #3 team out of 16. The next week, she comes into the store and my GM points me to her for a set of ring cameras. I help her. And as she walks out, I say \u201cwe\u2019ll always appreciate your business!\u201d\n\nTLDR; auto zone manager flips out. Curses Best Buy.

I do everything that is expected of a product flow employee and then some more. Shuttle and Planos are the most physically demanding jobs and you get no support with it either. 400lb fridge, 100 piece shuttle, multiple 85\" TV's etc etc. You name it, I've done it. My body is not the same as it was, yet BBY doesn't care. My peers and managers don't care. The CEO and share holders don't care. If we get broken nobody cares. All that matters to them is \"were you following sop\" for unloading\/handling oversized items.\n\nThe physical toll it takes on us is unreal. Even with using the right Dolly's and the right lifts it's still an extreme task, multiple times a week to do these things on your own. It's always meant to be a \"team lift\" where needed, yet we fired and cut so many people and scheduled people the bare minimum that team lifting anything is impossible when you're alone or the other people in the warehouse are injured... essentially making you do it alone.\n\nThe sales floor doesn't help, they hide behind their registers in groups of 2 to 4 at a time with leaders laughing and joking while you break your back daily and they don't even have the decency or respect to offer help. They're happy to accommodate their lunches and work needs to get bonuses....but any type of team work where they might break a sweat or get dirt on their hands...think again.

We are in a smaller market, so that minimum goal of $50k\/week was pretty rough. They also wanted a membership and a credit app every day.

I started in sales, moved up to sales leadership and then Autotech Lead. I ran the best HT dept this district had ever seen, pulled it up from mediocre to 9th in the entire company. Took over a 2+ year dark install bay and my 2nd year there, was about to get added headcount as it was add 60 hours every week. Then came Corrie and Covid. Bonuses stripped and bay was shut down moving me to another location. I was turned down for Supervisor spots for the past 5 years that I was more than qualified for and watched them give them to people with less experience and 0 skills. There was a GM while I was Autotech that didn't like how I wasn't there to fuck around or let him have parties in my bay and use it for storage. I let him have it one day when he tried to report me to HR for something he didn't even understand. \n\nI watched this company slowly fall apart and kill off all their good employees who had been there for many years, a lot of skill and knowledge left just so they could save a few bucks while they fly around in private jets and  run the company deeper down the shitter. My new GM of the past 6ish months decided to try to pull some bs on me a few times lately, blaming me for situations he created. I'm pretty sure this was retaliation for some things I said in the Blueprint Survey as his attitude changed completely towards me right after the results came out. My old GM who went out of his way to make sure I didn't move up now runs the micro market and I definitely saw a change in him towards me to the point where he didn't even acknowledge my existance the past several weeks since the survey. \n\nI was pushed out by 2 managers who don't know their heads from their asses. I had enough and walked out after putting up with all this for over 5 years. What really triggered me in the end was being told that I don't  care about the customers when I would always go over the top for every install I did. People loved me and my NPS reflected that. I put so much into that place to keep it running by myself with no help from anyone just to be treated like shit at every turn.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/17491o2\/i_give_up\/k48auub\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"BestBuyWorkers","reddit_link_id":"t3_17491o2","reddit_parent_id":"t3_17491o2","reddit_submission":"17491o2"},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2023-10-10T01:59:33","reddit_id":"k48nkaa","reddit_name":"t1_k48nkaa","reddit_created_utc":1696917573,"reddit_author":"ImTheEnigma","reddit_text":"At our store, the entire warehouse is gone or will be lmao.

My only concern is that once I start attending classes in January, will I have any problems with scheduling.  I am currently only interested in one of the part time positions.  I have worked for other big name retailers and most of them do not accommodate college class schedules.  They all offer things like tuition assistance (I am not concerned if BB offers that or not).  I have witness at similar companies that management will agree on working around your schedule, but then when push comes to shove and they need a worker that day.  They tell you its not their problem and you need to figure it out and they schedule you to work.  I am not saying Best Buy is this way, but the industry sure is.  I am going $250k into debt with school and don't want to worry about whether or not my employer is going to do this to me.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBased on your experience, what have you seen, witness or are aware of any policies to protect someone in that situation.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAgain, thank you all.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/174wtq6\/i_am_debating_on_applying_for_a_job_with_best_buy\/","reddit_title":"I am debating on applying for a job with Best Buy, but am going back to college.","reddit_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/174wtq6\/i_am_debating_on_applying_for_a_job_with_best_buy\/","reddit_subreddit":"BestBuyWorkers","reddit_link_id":null,"reddit_parent_id":null,"reddit_submission":null},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2023-10-10T18:06:37","reddit_id":"k4c4fql","reddit_name":"t1_k4c4fql","reddit_created_utc":1696975597,"reddit_author":"fallon_creziato","reddit_text":"I\u2019m a full time student (15 credit hours this semester at university) and work part time Geek Squad.

I had to remind them three times to change it; when they made the mistake, at my lunch, and when I clocked out. They finally changed it when I said I won't be coming in at all.\n\nMy revised schedule is Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday this week at 32 hours.

I'm in the same boat as you are and the best advice I can give you is to try to find value in the Plus or Total membership for the customer. Of course even if it saves them money and gives them peace of mind they may not take it. It should be a natural part of the conversation and not something you just bring up randomly. It's why getting to know your customer's problem is so important. You match what they need with the benefits of a membership and see if it'll provide value for them. If not it never hurts to ask just in case but ultimately don't sweat it if you don't end up getting the membership. BB business model is awful and it's not your fault the company relies on those memberships to make money. Take what I say with a grain of salt though I rarely ever make my daily quota.

I have a decent career making decent money, but things are expensive now. \n\nI was looking for a part time job and got one in the warehouse. The hiring manager told me she liked me and feels like I would be a good addition because everyone\u2019s work ethic is. \n\nFirst day I go in and do computer trainings and that was it. Was never given any further instruction on where to go or who to talk to for training. Haven\u2019t even seen my manager since, and basically have had to fend for myself. Asking where to go and how to do things. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing. I notice so much disfunction in the warehouse. People complain about having to find things or how they can\u2019t find anything. But every time there isn\u2019t a spot to put something and I ask what to do with it, they just say \u201cjust put it anywhere man\u201d. Like yo\u2026that\u2019s why we can never find anything. \n\nWhat\u2019s most annoying is that I can see why the managers are frustrated, BUT ITS THEIR FAULT! If things are messed up and you have a problem with the work ethic of the people currently working there, why would you let the same people train the new guys? Like get your hands dirty and be involved in new hire training. Otherwise the same cycle will just continue. \n\n\nRant over.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/17lnjrw\/new_employee_noticing_the_disfunction\/","reddit_title":"New employee noticing the disfunction","reddit_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/17lnjrw\/new_employee_noticing_the_disfunction\/","reddit_subreddit":"BestBuyWorkers","reddit_link_id":null,"reddit_parent_id":null,"reddit_submission":null},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2023-11-01T18:32:59","reddit_id":"k7fgxb1","reddit_name":"t1_k7fgxb1","reddit_created_utc":1698877979,"reddit_author":"carmachu","reddit_text":"Welcome to Best Buy.

It mostly happened when best buy laid off nearly all their warehouse sups and warehouse managers when they did a shuffle of leaders. Those who remain were forced to convert into other positions and operations has basically died in best buys eyes.... because they killed it intentionally. \n\nThose who remain are typically new hires or senior staff who are trying to hold it together. The leadership we have now are sales leaders....the people who have 0 experience with operations yet think they know everything, yet know nothing. It won't get any better. Give up hope and lower your expectations. Me and a few others are holding it together but are in the same boat. The only saving grace with me and my peers is our work ethic  and the need to have a functioning warehouse because it affects us more than the sales floor. It's rough, but we're holding it together. Don't rely on your leadership, rely on your peers. It's the only way you'll survive the holiday season.

If it's shuttle it's about accuracy, not just speed. Don't cut corners and make sure you read everything carefully on RSS and are not just blindly loading and unloading trucks. Doing shuttle is 2nd nature to me along with truck validation. Reddit isn't the place for training. You need experienced staff training you in person...if you can find them.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/184kpv0\/first_day_doing_truck_alone\/kawwjjz\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"BestBuyWorkers","reddit_link_id":"t3_184kpv0","reddit_parent_id":"t3_184kpv0","reddit_submission":"184kpv0"},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2023-11-26T21:08:45","reddit_id":"kax6d02","reddit_name":"t1_kax6d02","reddit_created_utc":1701050925,"reddit_author":"Annual_Appearance771","reddit_text":"For our store, it\u2019s pretty straightforward. Driver will back up, you\u2019ll get paper from them. We\u2019ll pop open the trailer door and usually there\u2019s a tote of straps and an envelope with manifest info and seals. The seal you put on when you\u2019re done is the just a +1 from the seal you took off (I.e. if seal you take off is 111111, next will be 111112 ). On the tc, I\u2019ll log into rss and go to shipping and receiving. You can find the manifest number from the paperwork in the envelope or search using your DC\u2019s number and a marking a shipped status. It\u2019ll pull up the manifest on the tc, and there will be a little arrow near the top for a drop down menu. From there, I go into manifest validation scan units as I pull them off. Once everything is unloaded and validated, I\u2019ll usually suspend it and back out. I\u2019m not sure on other stores policies, but you can receive it there and have the picks come through for units. If you have anything to load, go to shipping and receiving, and under the containers tab hit the plus button. If there\u2019s geek squad units (they\u2019ll have a white container instead of red, as well as a pink slip usually) you\u2019ll hit unload trailer. You\u2019ll have to scan the BOL number, usually really long and on the paperwork the driver handed to you or from the envelope. Then you\u2019ll scan the white containers to \u201cunload\u201d those units. After that, RSS will ask you if you want to load that trailer. This is for haul aways, service units, etc. you can hit yes and scan the containers to load them. (If you have nothing to unload, just hit the same plus button and just go to the load trailer option, then scan containers of units ready to send off. If there\u2019s nothing to unload or load, forget this step). If you loaded units, when you complete the loading, some paperwork should print out. 3 copies. You\u2019ll sign your name and date under shipper on all these copies, plus the paperwork the driver handed you. Go out to the driver, giving him his paperwork back. Then you\u2019ll have him sign the other 3 copies of the paperwork you printed. He\u2019ll keep one, one will go in the envelope, and the last you\u2019ll keep. I ask the driver if he wants a thumbs up or three kicks on the door to send him off. After that, head back inside and put a copy of your paperwork in the envelope, and make sure the envelope and strap tote are back in the trailer, as well as any units you sent off or units from other stores. Close the door and seal it, then kick it three times or give the driver a thumbs up.

For the E learning I try to find things I\u2019m more interested in so I can retain the information better or at least if I am not familiar or interested I know of the brand and I have somewhat of an idea what they are talking about. For example, some customers will ask me about CORSAIR and I am not an expert on that whatsoever but I was able to lookup what they needed with the SKU number or brand name and point them in the direction of the isle. When they ask me specific questions about the product I try to resonate with them and if I honestly don\u2019t know the answer I will look it up or try to pull up the features tab on the app under the product information to see if anything in there will answer their question. It can be a pain because the customer has to wait for me to answer but usually they appreciate the effort and if they get upset I usually just be like \u201cI\u2019m sorry I am not super familiar with this product but I can pair you up with someone who would know more about it if you up to wait until they are available to help you\u201d so it doesn\u2019t sound like I\u2019m completely helpless.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/18ajcq0\/customers_mad_at_me_when_i_try_to_help_them\/kc0slzo\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"BestBuyWorkers","reddit_link_id":"t3_18ajcq0","reddit_parent_id":"t3_18ajcq0","reddit_submission":"18ajcq0"},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2023-12-04T11:10:10","reddit_id":"kbyunwd","reddit_name":"t1_kbyunwd","reddit_created_utc":1701706210,"reddit_author":"1yungyoung","reddit_text":"yeah I had a guy yesterday ask me to speak with an expert in home audio.

(Being late, not calling out or no call no showing). It\u2019s been quite the experience over the last 20 months. The people I\u2019ve worked with, especially in product flow are some of the funniest, most hard-working people I\u2019ve ever known, and I was honored and privileged to work alongside them. \n\nWith that being said, Best Buy, as a corporation, is completely and utterly fucked. Starting at the top, Cori Berri is one of the worst executives I\u2019ve ever heard of. She constantly takes this company and drives it into the ground. It almost seems intentional at this point. She is a fucking idiot and I wouldn\u2019t trust her to run a lemonade stand, let alone a huge corporation. \n\nTo one of my managers in particular, you are an asshole. Plain and simple. You constantly call people out over the walkie for stupid things, knowing damn well that it could\u2019ve been a 1on1 conversation, or one that didn\u2019t need to occur in the first place. Instead, you sit on your ass or stand at the AP and belittle people. Idgaf how long you\u2019ve worked there, you\u2019re a dick and I hope you eat shit. You constantly bring morale down throughout the store and then wonder why people don\u2019t have good attitudes.\n\nTo the managers, STOP INTERRUPTING CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN SALES FLOOR AND CUSTOMERS. It has to be the most deflating thing in the world when you\u2019re having a good conversation with a customer, selling them product, learning about them and their interests, and then hearing over the walkie, \u201coo (salesperson\u2019s name), looks like a good membership opportunity\u201d. I hear that and I can feel the balloon being deflated. Fuck your stupid memberships, fuck your stupid credit cards, 99% of customers don\u2019t want it and you make the interactions worse by shoving it down their throats. \n\nWith that, Best Buy needs to bring back specialization. One of the biggest complaints that customers have is that \u201cyour sales floor doesn\u2019t know shit about the product.\u201d Well, how could they? Best Buy wants sales floor to be experts on thousands of products. You know what happens when you try to be an expert on everything? You\u2019re an expert on nothing. It\u2019s simply impossible. Best Buy is trying so hard to suck customer\u2019s dicks and yet, is actively pushing them away every single day. \n\nAll in all, I\u2019m predicting that Best Buy will not make it to 2030. I hope I\u2019m wrong because workers at Best Buy need jobs. But unfortunately, I see Best Buy following the footsteps of KMart straight to bankruptcy. The board needs to get Cori as far away as possible from Best Buy. \n\nBest of luck, \nFormer Product Flow Specialist","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/18ttsxk\/let_go_today\/","reddit_title":"Let Go Today","reddit_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/18ttsxk\/let_go_today\/","reddit_subreddit":"BestBuyWorkers","reddit_link_id":null,"reddit_parent_id":null,"reddit_submission":null},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2023-12-29T12:24:59","reddit_id":"kfgkct3","reddit_name":"t1_kfgkct3","reddit_created_utc":1703881499,"reddit_author":"trizzletru","reddit_text":"I worked there since before she became ce(ho), and I couldn't care how to spell her name.

Especially where the info is specific to doctor\u2019s excuses. Go to those resources instead of these faceless, credential lacking, unregulated internet lawyers for your guidance.\n\nI\u2019ll suggest looking at the sites of law firms that specialize in employment law and sick leave rights. When those attorneys say \u201cThe HIPAA privacy rule states that an employer may request a doctor\u2019s note from an employee, but only if it is necessary for an acceptable reason, like sick leave, Workers\u2019 Compensation, or health insurance.\u201d, it tells you that responses suggesting  employers can\u2019t require a doctors excuse are wrong. It could possibly still be contrary to a company\u2019s internal policy, but that still doesn\u2019t make it illegal.\n\nIn my place of employment, the doctor\u2019s excuses need only read that \u201cMr. Smith was seen in my office for illness or treatment and can return to work on this date with or without these restrictions\u201d. If there are no restrictions, you\u2019re allowed back to work. If there are restrictions, if the job you do can accommodate those restrictions, then you can come back to work. If we cannot accommodate those restrictions,  you can\u2019t return to work until those restrictions are lifted. Which also means a return to the doctor to provide the statement saying no restrictions. And that only means time off with pay if you have the PTO to burn. If you don\u2019t, you are off in an unpaid status. And in all of this, we obtain no information that violates HIPPA.\n\nOne thing to note is that if you don\u2019t have the PTO and you aren\u2019t in a protected status such as FMLA, you can be terminated for excessive absences. The loss of  a minimum wage job in a job rich environment may not be a big deal to a lot of people, but job history and a previous employer saying nothing more than \u201cineligible for rehire\u201d may impact your ability to replace that job or to get a position that is actually a well paying job down the road.\n\nAnd who came up with or approved  these policies? Attorneys licensed to practice law in our State. Not some yahoo practicing internet law.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/18rkcrr\/just_passed_out_on_the_floor\/kfeexbm\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"BestBuyWorkers","reddit_link_id":"t3_18rkcrr","reddit_parent_id":"t3_18rkcrr","reddit_submission":"18rkcrr"},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2023-12-29T03:33:17","reddit_id":"kfeg1r5","reddit_name":"t1_kfeg1r5","reddit_created_utc":1703849597,"reddit_author":"C8kester","reddit_text":"get a doctors note when you can. if you do go back and black out again get a witness to testify of the bullshit and sue or threaten to if they keep pushing you especially if there\u2019s another employee who found you blacked out. or less extreme contact hr and report the manager who gave you shit for being sick. you don\u2019t let people fuck with your health.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/18rkcrr\/just_passed_out_on_the_floor\/kfeg1r5\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"BestBuyWorkers","reddit_link_id":"t3_18rkcrr","reddit_parent_id":"t3_18rkcrr","reddit_submission":"18rkcrr"},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2023-12-29T07:28:59","reddit_id":"kff7p3q","reddit_name":"t1_kff7p3q","reddit_created_utc":1703863739,"reddit_author":"Brad32198","reddit_text":"Every retail store is a joke","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/18rkcrr\/just_passed_out_on_the_floor\/kff7p3q\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"BestBuyWorkers","reddit_link_id":"t3_18rkcrr","reddit_parent_id":"t3_18rkcrr","reddit_submission":"18rkcrr"},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2023-12-29T08:58:02","reddit_id":"kfflzcj","reddit_name":"t1_kfflzcj","reddit_created_utc":1703869082,"reddit_author":"Kazhmyr1","reddit_text":"I worked at BB holiday season of 2016.

I need to vent a bit about this...\n\nLike, seriously. My management team wants me to offer the membership in ALL the calls, even the ones for transactions where the customer is only interested in getting X cheap product (like just a CD Player or some headphones ledser than $ 100).  Even when the customer already told us they don't plan on getting a service! Just the product.\n\nMy manager is still pushing me a lot, I think he is also lying to me because I am still offering the membership in the majority of my calls (the only chances where I don't is where the customer already closes the phone on me before I start telling them about it \ud83e\udd23 without interrupting him)...and he is not seeing my effort!!! \ud83e\udd75\ud83e\udd75\ud83d\ude24\ud83d\ude24\ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8\ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8 Like, if the Membership is a Holy Grail or something I need to sell every week when realistically, I only get like 1 per month, and that's usually when the customer ALREADY desires the Membership, without me talking about it ~first.~\n\nEDIT: My supervisor is also threatening me with giving me some DA or disciplinary actions if I don't get a membership sale soon enough, or if I don't offer the membership in the 100% of my calls, as stated earlier, I cannot ALWAYS offer it because customers often start speaking first after my opening, and some of them also fade away after I mention the membership. I think that threat is just some form of emotional manipulation b*llshit. I mean, in the rest of the shift he seems like a good guy, but I'm pretty sure some of the rest other coworkers who are under my umbrella might think that this behavior may be too much, specially one of them that is a veteran in the same Call Center company and was pushed one time to keep offering the membership after he made an initial sale for other one. (Managers are paid to push people into this... huh? Okay, that last sentence may sound a bit of a stretch \ud83e\udd23)\n\nDo you know how to deal with this? I think my manager is still taking this sales job too far when we should focus first on providing help to our customers, then selling them our solutions...also, in advance, thanks for reading and I hope you have a great day.

(But I learned my own way so hey, it is what it is). I did LOVE the job at first\u2026but then I learned REAL QUICK; The company is a joke and so was nearly my entire team. Especially \u201cleadership\u201d. The whole entire store was even filled with drama and power hungry shift leads too. They didn\u2019t take a situation seriously that was \u201coutside of work\u201d which ended up inside of work. (As I worked with all parties involved in said situation) A whole situation (that I DID NOT start) blown out of proportion (& lied about) and didn\u2019t even want to hear my side (the right side) of it. So the the person who created the problem lied, sucked everyone\u2019s dick, and was near to get me fired because of the horrible things she said about me AND someone else. So, I quit the same day they pulled me in the SDR and \u201ctalked\u201d to me \u201cabout it\u201d when really it was only about numbers and corporate talk instead of trying to find a solution. I even brought up how the situation was affecting my work and slightly my mental health and they basically dismissed and disregarded it. Looks like you have to kiss ass and suck dick to even be seen\/heard\/promoted\/ whatever. And I\u2019m NOT that kind of person. They switch so fast to whoever is doing the best on the board. I USED to be top of the top but it had dropped, then I wasn\u2019t their favorite anymore and I was treated like \u201cthe rest of them\u201d. All the coaching they ever gave me was just complaining about not getting members and apps, but not finding a solution to help me with that either. FUCK BEST BUY! LMFAO Also if you were wondering my \u201cposition(s)\u201d I was the Certified Mobility Apple Pro Advisor & Wellness Ambassador. Never got a raise and never got full time. Complete fucking joke. \n\n\n(Also the notice above was written the same night after I got off of work that day they pulled me into the SDR room after the \u201ctalk\u201d. Sent straight to all the leaders\/supervisors\/GM\/etc BBY email. I know they got it because, they cleared my schedule for the rest of the month basically. LOL)\n\n\n(Sorry in advance for typos and a messy paragraph, just wanted to rant\/vent. In which I appreciate the read!

For this reason there are more upset client's whether you're telling them their manufacturer warranty doesn't cover their 1000$ laptops broken screen, or telling your turn time is 5+ days (unsure of your precincts turn time just an example), or telling then it can take 1-3 weeks for service center repairs.

Always remember if you are being taken advantage of, make a paper trail and ask hr if it's allowed. The moment they say no, your store will back off entirely.)\nSo many times we are found doing nothing in the back being lazy and having fun :) but every store member knows they can come to us for anything, we often will buddy up and help our store associates sell a total by them bringing their client to us to \"techy explain\" some technology or benefits. We never turn that down. But if we did all our job responsibilities, I'm sorry we aren't responsible for doing things outside our job description and we wont. Just as it's not blue shirts fault we are understaffed often.

Work hard, but not too hard. If you\u2019re trying to get promoted within your store then personal performance matters, but it doesn\u2019t in the eyes of corporate. Being likeable by others is often more important than your numbers when it comes to promotions.\n\n2. Your experience in retail will vastly be determined by the managers at the store. If you don\u2019t like your management, look for another store in the area and switch over. The extra 10 minute drive is worth not hating your life every single day you clock in.\n\n3. There is no job security in retail. The position you\u2019re working now will most likely not exist in another year or two. If you can\u2019t constantly adapt to new roles, stores, and responsibilities, then retail isn\u2019t for you. (This isn\u2019t exclusive to BBY)\n\n4. Don\u2019t be afraid to apply for positions you don\u2019t feel qualified for. I got a work-from-home corporate position after being in retail for a long time with no degree; again, you need to be likeable by others.\n\n5. Steer clear of post-military employees, specifically those in management roles. They take their jobs way too fucking seriously and you don\u2019t get paid enough for that bullshit. This isn\u2019t the Marines, it\u2019s Best Buy for Christ\u2019s sake.\n\n6. Stand up for yourself. I see too many people get walked over by others at this job.\n\n7. Don\u2019t fuck with the installers; be nice to them. Leave notes on your orders. The installers are your best friends if you take care of them, I\u2019ve had many go back to job sites and clean up some of my mistakes on orders. They\u2019ll save you from many angry customers.\n\n8. Don\u2019t fuck with the Geek Squad employees either. See above point for reference. \n\n9. HR doesn\u2019t mess around. In 99% of cases it\u2019s so much easier for them to fire someone. If you actually use the HR hotline as you should, you will see someone lose their job (provided you have a valid case).\n\n10. You may see your position as a career, but corporate does not. The reality is that 99% of retail positions have high turnover rates, and corporate treats them this way.\n\n11. The current sales model is extremely broken and a far cry from what it used to be at Best Buy. You are making less money than previously and it\u2019s 100% intentional.\n\n12. Your mental health and physical health come first. The worst that happens is you lose your job, and that\u2019s totally okay. There\u2019s plenty of work out there, Best Buy doesn\u2019t own you. Do your best to communicate absences though as quickly as you can to avoid repercussions at work. \n\nI\u2019ll also answer any questions people have.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/199f5h8\/left_best_buy_after_six_years_some_tips_and\/","reddit_title":"Left Best Buy After Six Years; Some Tips and Advice for those Employed.","reddit_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/199f5h8\/left_best_buy_after_six_years_some_tips_and\/","reddit_subreddit":"BestBuyWorkers","reddit_link_id":null,"reddit_parent_id":null,"reddit_submission":null},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2024-01-17T21:46:32","reddit_id":"kidpw7z","reddit_name":"t1_kidpw7z","reddit_created_utc":1705545992,"reddit_author":"Major_Television166","reddit_text":"Preach sista","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/199f5h8\/left_best_buy_after_six_years_some_tips_and\/kidpw7z\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"BestBuyWorkers","reddit_link_id":"t3_199f5h8","reddit_parent_id":"t3_199f5h8","reddit_submission":"199f5h8"},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2024-01-17T23:11:41","reddit_id":"kie231y","reddit_name":"t1_kie231y","reddit_created_utc":1705551101,"reddit_author":"Elegant_Record9340","reddit_text":"And one last thing: have an open mind.

I\u2019ve done just about every role except for management (I don\u2019t have the right personality lol). There have been ups and downs. I\u2019ve worked with many people; most good, honest, and hard working. \n\nI tried working in an office for two years while being O\/S and I hated it. I thought that the nature of the work was a net positive for the world. I learned quickly that the grass isn\u2019t always greener, it\u2019s just a matter of how well you maintain it. I came back and switched roles again. Felt like I was home.\n\nI started at the bottom as a part time home business group sales associate. I know the anxiety of only having 12 hours on my schedule. The resentment towards others receiving preferential treatment. The realization that life isn\u2019t fair and that sometimes you come up short. All these lessons hurt but I still learned a lot about not only myself but how the business works. \n\nBest Buy is a company that\u2019s being ruined from the top down, but it\u2019s provided a lot for me and my family. I have two good cars and time off to enjoy working on them. I can see my family and friends regularly. I wouldn\u2019t have graduated college without this job, nor would I ever be in a place where I felt I could finally become a father. \n\nI don\u2019t know how much longer this company has. It can be ten years or ten months. But it gave me an education and a hell of a resume. More personally, it gave me friends that have lasted me years and memories that I\u2019ll always cherish. \n\nSorry for the wall of text, just happy to see someone else has had a decent time here.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/1adjykm\/almost_7_years_tbf_its_actually_been_a_pretty\/kk3abih\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"BestBuyWorkers","reddit_link_id":"t3_1adjykm","reddit_parent_id":"t3_1adjykm","reddit_submission":"1adjykm"},{"aware_post_type":"submission","aware_created_ts":"2024-01-31T11:46:37","reddit_id":"1afm8j1","reddit_name":"t3_1afm8j1","reddit_created_utc":1706719597,"reddit_author":"User83829362","reddit_text":"\n\n[View Poll](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/poll\/1afm8j1)","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/1afm8j1\/next_layoffs_will_hit\/","reddit_title":"Next layoffs will hit","reddit_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/1afm8j1\/next_layoffs_will_hit\/","reddit_subreddit":"BestBuyWorkers","reddit_link_id":null,"reddit_parent_id":null,"reddit_submission":null},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2024-01-31T12:37:03","reddit_id":"kob4j2c","reddit_name":"t1_kob4j2c","reddit_created_utc":1706722623,"reddit_author":"Darkvamp69","reddit_text":"Greedy, greedy company.

Mine is through Delta Dental and VSP, which I haven't had any issues with at all yet. :) just recently got my new pair of glasses too..","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/1aesmhl\/full_time_insurance_recommendations\/ko8nrft\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"BestBuyWorkers","reddit_link_id":"t3_1aesmhl","reddit_parent_id":"t3_1aesmhl","reddit_submission":"1aesmhl"},{"aware_post_type":"submission","aware_created_ts":"2024-02-02T09:20:16","reddit_id":"1ah4riy","reddit_name":"t3_1ah4riy","reddit_created_utc":1706883616,"reddit_author":"Think_Pudding_6412","reddit_text":"I\u2019m assuming the one on SOP is now invalid because everybody at my store was logged out about a week ago and the one on the PDF file doesn\u2019t work.

Internal and external factors come into play for a lot of it. I won\u2019t go into specifics on it because I\u2019m sure you know about theft, inventory issues, bad returns\/exchanges etc.. as for the walking business aspect. From my understanding the company prides itself on giving the customer you are with a 10\/10 experience while providing a complete solution for them. If you can build that trust and relationship with your customer then you will gaining a potential long term or life long customer who will shop more often and spend more money. Unfortunately that means you walk a lot of other customers due to not having product or long wait times. The company stands by their commitment that they would rather walk many more potential customers if it means the ones that are in front of us are taken care of. Which in retrospect, if we don\u2019t forcibly change the customers way of thinking and how to shop then it won\u2019t even matter. The plan is move all that to instore\/in home consultant and designers who can give that experience and build a package and everyone else needs to order online for store pickup. The stores will become just show rooms with minimal grab and go product on display. (Think Apple Store or carrier phone store). This will reduce a lot of retail operating costs and make up for all the erosion that you speak of. Best Buy is going to become a cross between a vendor show room with demos and an Amazon fulfillment type center for item pickup.

At first, I thought this might be an honest mistake, but I googled the guy it was being delivered to and all his mugshots came up.  So I figured my sales guy was receiving kickbacks.  I call Best Buy and I tell them what happened and ask them to correct the delivery address.

I've been worried since last November about ours. Our busy season last fiscal year had us booked out at least a month in advance while these last few months we've been booked out at MOST 8 or 9 days during our supposed busy season. At one point I was pulling shifts as a CA up at the precinct because labor was so short, now they're pulling labor from the precinct so I can still work my hours doing what I enjoy in my designated position. The problem now is our precinct is running into a labor shortage as well and I feel as if management will probably start cutting us down to 1 CA and 1 ARA at any given time.\n\nTechnically our bay is supposed to have a part time and a full time tech, but was changed years before I was moved to autotech and we have 2 full time. My thoughts are by the end of summer they will either drop my position to part time or kill it entirely since it's no longer sustainable because we aren't generating enough labor to pay for it, or close our bay entirely and expand our warehouse. The only thing keeping our bay afloat now is the fact that we're the only open bay for quite a long distance and NOT booked out a month.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/1awjt9k\/bay_closures\/","reddit_title":"Bay Closures","reddit_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/1awjt9k\/bay_closures\/","reddit_subreddit":"BestBuyWorkers","reddit_link_id":null,"reddit_parent_id":null,"reddit_submission":null},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2024-02-21T13:55:24","reddit_id":"krhmrci","reddit_name":"t1_krhmrci","reddit_created_utc":1708541724,"reddit_author":"Retro_Sphynx","reddit_text":"Most stores in my area closed their bays down coming out of the pandemic, many of them permanently.

He would get his ass reamed when he would come into the back of the precinct to \u201cask a question\u201d (aka flirt with me before we started dating) and his ass was rightfully reamed. There\u2019s not really a reason VPLs should be behind the precinct. HOWEVER I moved positions to become full time and became a VPL (TMO). At this point we were not dating but eventually spending every shift together 8 hrs a day\/ 5 days a week became the beginning of our relationship. We set CLEAR BOUNDARIES to continue to do our work without making it weird or obnoxious. Our managers knew and I even suggested getting us put on opposite schedules so we weren\u2019t being shown any favoritism. You\u2019re allowed to love who you love but PROFESSIONALISM is key regardless if it\u2019s just Best Buy. Your EM needs to piss off if he\u2019s doing it for no reason but I\u2019ve also been in his position and seen couples that can\u2019t stay away and employees complain. Set your drinks in the break room and give her space. Your em is most likely getting pressure from employees management and the GM to get the distractions under control. Not to mention if your numbers aren\u2019t great, they will target you for shitty performance.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/1ayeafw\/management_issue\/krvmeve\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"BestBuyWorkers","reddit_link_id":"t3_1ayeafw","reddit_parent_id":"t3_1ayeafw","reddit_submission":"1ayeafw"},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2024-02-23T19:35:55","reddit_id":"krun3f7","reddit_name":"t1_krun3f7","reddit_created_utc":1708734955,"reddit_author":"raul_2011","reddit_text":"What area do you work in, and how close is it to front end?","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/1ayeafw\/management_issue\/krun3f7\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"BestBuyWorkers","reddit_link_id":"t3_1ayeafw","reddit_parent_id":"t3_1ayeafw","reddit_submission":"1ayeafw"},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2024-02-23T23:28:24","reddit_id":"krvk365","reddit_name":"t1_krvk365","reddit_created_utc":1708748904,"reddit_author":"Hopeful_Ebb5443","reddit_text":"Sounds like your EM loves your GF","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/1ayeafw\/management_issue\/krvk365\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"BestBuyWorkers","reddit_link_id":"t3_1ayeafw","reddit_parent_id":"t3_1ayeafw","reddit_submission":"1ayeafw"},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2024-02-23T18:35:43","reddit_id":"krudra0","reddit_name":"t1_krudra0","reddit_created_utc":1708731343,"reddit_author":"Academic_Bit_594","reddit_text":"Sounds like your EM wants your girl\u2026 and wants to drive a wedge between you two","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/1ayeafw\/management_issue\/krudra0\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"BestBuyWorkers","reddit_link_id":"t3_1ayeafw","reddit_parent_id":"t3_1ayeafw","reddit_submission":"1ayeafw"},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2024-02-23T22:05:06","reddit_id":"krv8z6u","reddit_name":"t1_krv8z6u","reddit_created_utc":1708743906,"reddit_author":"Mrsexfr","reddit_text":"I would like it to be known i have ZERO issue with staying away from the front when she\u2019s there.

In an effort to meander my way into more responsibility, I became our stores first shift lead back when the program went national and I did it to be able to help out my team, grow my skills, and overcome obstacles that not having access to certain systems presented. Great, except theres one glaring issue: Im an ARA and the shift lead program was clearly never intended to have ARAs become shift lead capable.\n\nFor an advisor or CA in wage group 10, the bump to base pay WG40 when scheduled as a lead makes sense, it may not be a big bump depending on how close they are to cap, but generally you still make something going from WG10 to WG40. The issue is that the flex pay program for shift leads automatically puts you at the base rate of WG40, even if you're someone like myself who makes more than that. What does that mean? It means that when I get scheduled as a lead, I actually take a pay cut of $1.22 despite going from WG30 to WG40 because im approaching cap. Because of this, its not been sensible for me to be scheduled as a lead for going on a year now, but because I don't mind the extra work I'm used as a floating lead essentially whenever I work.\n\nYou would think I would put my foot down and be angry that I get no additional compensation for the extra work (part of me is), but to be honest most of what I do and have access to just make my job and my precincts job easier so I look over it (IE: Schedule making, overrides, NOVA admin, back office\/superuser, procurement\/ariba, DBT - but NOT powerBI since you have to be scheduled as a lead once every 7 days for powerBI to populate data).\n\nBeing said, even though i've basically accepted the extra responsibility, it still doesn't cover up the fact that the flex pay program and wage group system is broken when it comes to ARAs or anyone outside of WG10 as a whole.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/1b5aepu\/flex_pay_wage_groups_are_broken_for_aras\/","reddit_title":"Flex pay & Wage groups are broken for ARAs","reddit_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/1b5aepu\/flex_pay_wage_groups_are_broken_for_aras\/","reddit_subreddit":"BestBuyWorkers","reddit_link_id":null,"reddit_parent_id":null,"reddit_submission":null},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2024-03-03T09:20:05","reddit_id":"kt5epwt","reddit_name":"t1_kt5epwt","reddit_created_utc":1709475605,"reddit_author":"Bread_Aggravating","reddit_text":"Talk to your leaders.

While its true that the labor comes in the form of leadership, BOP, FOP, etc, and the activity can be virtually whatever they would like, the job is what determines your pay, such as sales generalist WG10, Consultation WG10, precinct repair WG30, and the three shift leads (Employee, Process and customer) WG40. \n\nChanging the job from WG30 to WG10 for example, as in an ARA being scheduled to work as a CA, changes your wages for that job from your primary pay to a \"pay-by-job\" rate. If you go down a WG, such as going WG30 down to WG10, then you get the highest pay available for WG10, but if you go up a WG such as WG30 to WG40 then you go to the lowest pay of that WG even if your normal pay is higher. The only reason im confident in saying this is because we experimented with this several months back and discovered that both scenarios (going up to WG40 and down to WG10) do exactly as I outlined.\n\nIn principle that should still be fine since you should be able to just keep the job as the default, while changing department to leadership and activity to leadership which then just flags the mix as bad and you just manually approve it, however market and corporate HR are cracking down on this and telling stores to stop doing this since it completely negates the flex pay and pay-by-job system.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/BestBuyWorkers\/comments\/1b5aepu\/flex_pay_wage_groups_are_broken_for_aras\/kt8xjdt\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"BestBuyWorkers","reddit_link_id":"t3_1b5aepu","reddit_parent_id":"t1_kt5epwt","reddit_submission":"1b5aepu"},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2024-03-03T22:44:04","reddit_id":"kt8yykr","reddit_name":"t1_kt8yykr","reddit_created_utc":1709523844,"reddit_author":"TJW595","reddit_text":"(Happy Cake Day!)\n\nThis is the same issue that our Sr has run into but for a while they were overusing him on the floor and he couldnt do anything to help out in the precinct.
