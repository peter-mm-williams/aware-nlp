The conversation is about a former employee's experience of retaliation after reporting sexual harassment at a Best Buy store in Orlando. The employee was sexually harassed by their supervisor in late 2019 and reported the incident. However, instead of addressing the issue, the employee's employment took a turn for the worse. The supervisor had high sales, which made it difficult for the company to take action against him. After the supervisor's termination, the employee felt uncomfortable and unsafe at work due to the General Manager's (GM) behavior towards them. The employee shared their concerns about a family member of the former supervisor, who was a seasonal employee and had a history of violent behavior. However, the GM kept him in the store with a promotion as a full-time employee. The GM began ignoring the employee, and they felt targeted and under scrutiny.

The employee approached the GM about transferring to another location, but the GM never followed up. The employee called human resources to report their fear of retaliation, but they never reached out again. Six different managers confirmed that the GM had it out for the employee.
