The conversation is about a former employee's experience of retaliation after reporting sexual harassment at a Best Buy store in Orlando. The employee was sexually harassed by their supervisor in late 2019 and reported the incident. However, instead of addressing the issue, the employee's employment took a turn for the worse. The supervisor had high sales, which made it difficult for the company to take action against him. After the supervisor's termination, the employee felt uncomfortable and unsafe at work due to the General Manager's (GM) behavior towards them.
