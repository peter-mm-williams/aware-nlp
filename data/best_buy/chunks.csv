Sr role eliminated; Good luck y‚Äôall,12m0ozl
I was there almost 5 years before my position was gone. They had no trouble eliminating the position of someone else that was there for almost 30 years. Best Buy does not care about you.,jg9its6
Hopefully that means 1 of ours is gone then.,jg8omf0

I believe all consults were cut today. We lost ours in the Omaha area.,jgan2du

"Ex Best Buy employee considering going back; Hey everyone, so like the title says I‚Äôm an ex employee from back in 2016-2018. I currently work for a Ralph‚Äôs as a PT and I just got a call from Best Buy for an interview after applying for a FT  position to test the waters. I only have a few ideas of how it‚Äôs been since Covid but can anyone let me know what it‚Äôs been like and if I should stay with Ralph‚Äôs or go with Best Buy again.  When I left Best Buy from start to finish I was CT, home theater, then smart home when it first started up. Thanks in advance for the advice everyone.",12l3md8

"I worked there for 13 years, then left for a few to work for the railroad‚Ä¶ learned that all the money in the world isn‚Äôt worth anything unless you‚Äôre awake to enjoy it, so took a big (BIG) pay cut to go back to bby. Didn‚Äôt regret the decision in the slightest.  After five years back I‚Äôve moved on again, this time probably for good. But I have zero regrets about working there, either time.",jg67xys
If you put a gun to my head and told me I had to go back I‚Äôd gladly pull the trigger myself.,jg5uibn
I‚Äôve been with the company from 2014 to now; held multiple positions and now just do PT with minimal hours so I can focus on my full time career. I‚Äôve enjoyed working for the company for my time here- things have changed a lot throughout the years we went from RPH and Credit apps to credit apps and totaltech. Most stores don‚Äôt separate into departments anymore; we‚Äôre all ‚ÄúSales Advisors‚Äù and sell everywhere in the store. With past experience you can haggle up to 17/hr but that is max for hiring. Overall; it‚Äôs still enjoyable but it‚Äôs what you make of it.,jg6d35v
"I work as a Double Agent in the field. It's a pretty great job. Complete freedom to pretty much run your own business. Great pay and 4 day work days. If you like to drive and can mount a TV and setup a receiver, it's a pretty easy job.",jgap992
Do not fuckin go back bro,jgbzl5f

Just got the interview for a Best Buy associate. Is this job enjoyable?; So I know everyone gets the recorded questions interview but I‚Äôve now gotten offered to do the 2nd interview. I applied as an associate and was just wondering if this job is an enjoyable one. I‚Äôve worked at Kohls and Walmart in the past and both were hell. Hoping my love for technology and knowing best buy is a bit more sophisticated will lead to a more enjoyable work experience. Any negatives I should be aware of?,12gb7ps
I have worked there a while and in my opinion precovid I would highly recommend but since then it‚Äôs going down hill. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they close stores,jfld1yx
It always depends on the store environment and the leaders. People‚Äôs experiences will vary greatly out of that. I‚Äôve worked in multiple stores and have had positive experiences.,jfkaru8
"Former warehouse gremlin here, I worked at two different best buy locations and it was hands down way better then Walmart. It is a brain numbing experience but once you get to know who‚Äôs in your department(and that their chill) you‚Äôll enjoy it, it‚Äôs not that miserable all the time.",jfmwxzt
"Just be careful.  BBY is one of the *better* options in working retail, but the company still sucks. I worked there in 2016-17 started in PT sales and worked my way up to FT sales lead until my role was discontinued 1 week into the position. The benefits are just okay and discount pretty generous. However, they focus very hard on unrealistic sales goals, management can be very pushy, and they restructure/eliminate positions/headcount ALL THE TIME.  &#x200B;  More recently, I returned to BBY part time in warehouse (1 day a week, just barely working enough for the discount), but later left just before the holiday season because I did not want to work anymore hours and they were really pressuring me to work. It was a bit more relaxed for me the second time around, mainly because it was 4 hours a week and I did not really care. Warehouse is still very metric/numbers driven, but it's different because you don't have to deal with customers as much, and most of the goals are pretty obtainable depending on how organized your warehouse team is. Although, it's almost impossible to move up in warehouse as your strengths don't show as much as they would in sales/customer service.  &#x200B;  That being said, it can be very easy to move up if you have a positive attitude, play the game of being peppy in their cringe company culture, and obtain/exceed your sales goals. With the turnover, you could land yourself a supervisor position in just a few years. Just don't be discouraged when they restructure and eliminate it, I can guarantee you at some point it will happen.  If you've worked for Walmart, I'm sure BBY is the better option, just learn to play their game. I could be wrong, but I would peg BBY to be in a similar line as Target & Starbucks in regards to quality of the company, but this is just observations and I could be wrong.  &#x200B;  I've also heard Costco has decent benefits, but can't speak to the internal workings of the company and culture. I did work for Apple Retail and really enjoyed working there and was sad when I left to work at a 'real job'.  &#x200B;  WDD",jfqvf59
"This is my honest opinion I just recently left Best Buy after almost a year as part time computer sales. It has its ups and downs.  I found most of my coworkers to be incredible and people I still talk to now after leaving. The work can be easy on slow days as you‚Äôre just Downstocking and facing things.  But the worst part is management and metrics. Although your store may be different, this is just my experience, At my store, some associates are getting paid less then minimum wage. You get no incentive for pushing sales. You‚Äôre basically a scummy sales man. You push and push and if it doesn‚Äôt work you get reprimanded by management. Even having your hours cut down to 4 hours a week if you don‚Äôt meet your goals.  You don‚Äôt get recognized for your efforts but i understand that‚Äôs a lot of workplaces now. A lot of management were misogynistic and did not want to hire women. I could go on and on You honestly might get a pay cut going from Walmart to Best Buy and they very rarely give raises",jfu2ko9
"If you don‚Äôt follow the ‚Äúvision‚Äù of management, be prepared to pay for it dearly. Hour cuts, lectures, no promotions and pay increases, etc. If you‚Äôre not meeting the expectations of being a minimum wage employee getting paid hourly AND selling like a commissioned salesman, then expect full annihilation from your leaders. If you fill their pockets with bigger bonuses because of your high numbers, they will adore you. Beware though, if you start struggling, you will become the enemy.",jfxqz67

Don‚Äôt do it you will get keys and forever will be owned lol,jfesu6j
"It's like running the floor and having additional managerial duties, not really a bad thing but they better pay you more for it. It definitely can become a bad thing but I see it kind of as a test for future promotion and what not tbh. You'll have more responsibilities like answering pages, having special keys, getting manager override codes, and having to deal with disgruntled employees more often. I don't know how your store operates but this is primarily what a ""Shift Lead"" does at ours. Not a huge difference but can absolutely be abused.",jfiq5rv
"laid off after 30+ years; Hi, my mom just informed me she was laid off after 30+ years of working there. I am so upset, she is the hardest working person I know- to the point it affects her health. She had only been written up once in her whole career over some stupid thing she believes was targeted. They are offering severance but on the basis that she does not sue. I‚Äôm just at a loss right now- she goes into work an hour early and has come home at 5am from doing inventory. I know corporate culture really does not give a fuck about you but??? This is such an insult to everything she‚Äôs worked for, and a few years before she retires??? Is there anything that could be done",12e4wef

Now I owe a lot of money this year because they withheld less than $300. Usually it's a couple thousand.

"Best Buy Is Closing 17 Stores This Week, With Many More Planned",11hyxkb
"A lot of retailers are right now including Walmart. I don't see this as a it's the end kind of thing. Especially since we are also still opening, moving and remodeling stores. Some stores need to close for how dead they are. It doesn't make sense to keep them open.",javrx5l
"Today is the final day for my old store. Bittersweet in all honesty. Miss the glory days of this company, but corporate has made its mess.",jaxlkxu
"I am sorry to all of the workers that are gonna be affected by this. I know exactly how you feel. If you are bored enough to read my stupid life story:  I was part of the grand opening team for a Best Buy in 2006.  35,000 ft.¬≤ I was full-time media, basically a senior, but without the actual position or pay.  We had six managers, 12 supervisors, many seniors, and full timers.  I went through the reorg in 2009 and barely kept my position. Supervisors drop to five, managers drop to four.  My stress gave me ulcers.  Our goals got to unrealistic math levels.  In gaming we had to have 8% service plans, accessories 12.5%, 3% geek squad set up services for consoles ($30 to turn the system on and run updates lol).  I had done the math at the time and management was unpleasant with me when I said this was not possible. Nintendo Wii accessory sales when we had no wii remotes 70 nunchucks.  Assuming we literally sold geek squad, black tie protection on each possible device we would not hit our numbers.  And that‚Äôs assuming that customers come in and literally buy everything we tell them to.    Speaking of more unrealistic, I was told on a Monday morning to replace all of the price tag‚Äôs in gaming, because the wordage for performance replacement, plan (PRP) was rebranded to geek squad black-tie protection replacement plan (GSBTPRP).  I remember telling them that it wasn‚Äôt going to happen today and they got upset. Then I used math to show them that approximately 30 4ft sections of games, each having six shelves, minimum seven tags per row assuming that each game magically had its own spot on the shelf and wasn‚Äôt stacked in front of another game.  Telzon taking about 10sec per tag in our shitty faraday cage of a store.  Takes about 10 sec to remove old tag and put on new tag.  35 hours of labor assuming the tag printer doesn‚Äôt jam, zero customers need help, etc.  and all of this was less than 24 hours after an adset, so basically we had to redo adset is what corporate wanted.  management hated me.  Then there was the gaming initiative in 2011 where I was so optimistic that things were turning around.    At this point I was trying to raise a family and thought this would actually be my career. But then we didn‚Äôt receive enough labor for our team",jaxs9zv
"thought this would actually be my career. But then we didn‚Äôt receive enough labor for our team full-time or had to work 32 1/2 hours supervisor 37 minimum.  We had two part-timers that got about 12 hours each.  Best Buy was talking about how bad shrink was and gaming, just like it always has been, and just like it always will be, but we did not have the labor to be staffed during each open hour.  Not to mention any labor for truck, adset, etc.  Then my position was removed August 2012.  The writing was on the wall.  I could either take severance or any of the available full-time positions that would exist.  Problem is there are three stores in our area, not counting the Best Buy mobiles.  So it was a dog pile of people for one or two positions that paid less than what we made five years ago at that point.    I took the severance, eight years of professional workmanship gone.  but a lot of my former friends and colleagues were still stuck on the Best Buy train wreck.  I joined this sub Reddit just to see how things have been going but it‚Äôs not very optimistic. Most of my bad dreams have been of regular work at Best Buy.  Now, almost everyone I know is out of Best Buy and has long since moved on. Years ago, Best Buy got rid of 401(k), matching I remember reading. Which is the most petty way of saying we don‚Äôt care about our employees and we are pretending that this is a cost savings measure.  The few old coworkers that remained said that they are sharing a manager between multiple stores. Almost nobody is full-time. They have like two supervisors. Which means some key holders are literally part time, so have no stake in the company.  All risk no reward.  Pay is capped at comical levels.  I just needed to get all that off my chest.

Even after all this time, I still haven't sold a single membership. I keep changing tactics, but I usually get a ""I'll think about it"" or they say no before I can finish.

From someone who doesn‚Äôt work for Best Buy anymore. Just ask questions about what people are buying or doing not just today but in the near future. That‚Äôs all my team did and we killed it. Let the customer bring the products up and you can add value by connecting the dots.  Hey. So you‚Äôre buying this computer today. What else have you been looking at? Maybe find out if they have moved recently to add tv appliances or home security. Don‚Äôt just focus on the one item. When you get shot down once or twice don‚Äôt give up. You won‚Äôt connect a lot. I compare it to baseball. The best hitters only get hits 3 out of 10 times. Hope that helps  Good luck. Stay strong.,jaios8m
"I am a PC DA so this is going to be from a Geek Squad perspective, and it‚Äôs easier for me to sell because it‚Äôs usually cheaper to sell it than what the price of the job would be without TT, but I typically take the ‚Äúnot a salesy salesperson‚Äù approach because I don‚Äôt enjoy pushy salespeople.  In store, you could do this by explaining that TT includes discounts and since it covers services and labor on what they are purchasing, a new PC setup & migration in-store or in-home would be cheaper with TT, plus it includes a better warranty on most devices.   ‚ÄúWould you like me to have one of our Geek Squad agents come set up your new computer? They can transfer the data and make sure everything is working. If you have any questions a few weeks after using it, they can come back out. Typically appointments are $130+ per visit, but with TT, it would just be $200 for the entire year.‚Äù If they start to roll their eyes, I usually feel weird because sales feels gross, so I say, ‚ÄúI know, I have to mention it because it‚Äôs a really good deal,‚Äù and then I will just move right along. Maybe mention it again a little later, ‚Äúso you‚Äôre going to set this up and transfer your data yourself, right?‚Äù *As I type this, I am realizing I am a manipulative little shit and maybe I do like sales hmm‚Ä¶*  Do you know any of the Geek Squad agents in your precinct? I know salespeople in the store will mention my name when they offer in-home services; It may feel more personable that way. If you mention a specific agent with experience in what you‚Äôre client is purchasing, they may feel like they are getting the hook-up *(‚ÄúChristineth is our Apple guru so if you‚Äôre having iCloud issues, we could book an appointment for her to come sync your devices AND show you how to use this Apple Pencil I am selling you?‚Äù)* and it might help the client feel more comfortable with an agent coming out if they don‚Äôt typically utilize home services. *Hmm it‚Äôs just Christineth. She won‚Äôt judge my model train collection.*  If you sell a printer, you can have an agent set it up on the client‚Äôs Wi-Fi, show them how to print/scan from any device, how to replace the cartridges, all that",jal199t
"show them how to print/scan from any device, how to replace the cartridges, all that printer stuff. If there are any issues with said printer, GS can come back out to troubleshoot.  Offer installation for security cameras, tablets, doorbells, modem/routers, TVs, soundbars, computer speakers, smart switches, a Roku, etc. I have gone to homes to set up a $20 wireless mouse or connect a $40 webcam. Probably unlikely that you will be able to sell $200 memberships on a little accessory like that very often, but I think it helps to talk about it with everyone. Some people are rich and dumb as hell. I say that with love.   If they are buying one thing and mention their slow internet, an agent can come out, set up the product and check the internet speeds/equipment while they are there (just make sure to book the appointment with enough time).  The warranty that is included with TT is pretty baller too + vague in-store discounts lol.

Sometimes a little stressful and got too much going on at once, but if you've worked a rush in a restaurant you're probably used to worse. If they got hours for ya, I'd send her. But in my experience it's who you work with, not what you're doing. So vet them as they vet you. Maybe go in before applying and get the vibe. Talk to a sales rep at the place. Wear a mask if you wanna be a little incognito.   Talking about tech while enjoying air conditioning isn't the worst. But everything comes with some bullshit",jabj8x3

Chances of moving roles?; I am a full-time student that is going to school for cybersecurity & networking. I do not have a technical background.

"Yeah, you need to land that role first before thinking about transferring. I like where your head's at, though. If you land that role, I would suggest learning which side of GS you would want to go to, learn who the leader is and get to know them. That helps immensely",j9lbv8x

BB more or less bends the rules for consultants.

"LG 48"" C2; Hi. Bought the new LG 48"" C2 TV from Best Buy. Also bought 5 year Geek Squad. Within 2 weeks, TV had a white line running vertically down middle of screen that does not go away no matter what I try to fix. As they sold me a defective product, I want them to replace the TV. But they refuse to replace and will only send out Geek tech to replace panel. What to do??",1142913
if its past 15 days and you have no TT then we will not return it just repair,j8tqznm
"If you bought it within the last 14 days, you should be able to swap for a replacement unit.  If it has been longer than two weeks, GSP states BBY can attempt up to three repairs before being required to replace it with the same or equivalent product.  If you get lucky, you might get a Manager willing to swap it out for you instead of 3 repairs.",j8ty5z1
"I‚Äôve had Geek Squad replace the panel on my LG C1 and it‚Äôs a very simple process. They order a new part directly from LG, they show up, and it takes about 30 minutes for them to swap the processor and everything over to the new panel. Then you‚Äôre good to go! And everything is completely professional and legitimate. The repair and part itself is provided and authorized by LG itself.",j8vcy5c
Call corporate. They‚Äôll fix you right up. 8 year veteran of Best Buy.,j8xqq5l
TT just extends your return policy from 15-60 days if u were at day 61 the same rules apply except with TT you would pay a service fee to get scheduled a repair appointment,j99yn2m
"Wish someone had explained to me that there are many tech repair plans. Had I known there was a difference bw Geek and TT, I would have opted for latter.  As of now, they are going to replace panel. Will this repair panel be a genuine LG replacement part?",j8u5g5m

I‚Äôm not a warehouse employee but I often hear that they don‚Äôt take their lunches,j8i3val

Because breaks are ‚Äúas business permits‚Äù and ‚Äúpaid‚Äù they aren‚Äôt required as an ex warehouse sup I made sure my employees got them when possible especially on truck nights as I threw truck with my team and understood that 15 minute refresh however lunches are mandatory as they are unpaid.,j99z0a3

"It‚Äôs purposeful. If it was not this way all of our time would be answering non-paid tech calls about a constellation of poorly explained and non-Best-Buy-commerce related things.

I‚Äôm sorry every one feels that I am racist. I am not. I‚Äôm a minority who‚Äôs parents come from another country.

I dont know how many in-home orders i've done (as a PC agent) where i end up troubleshooting Home Theater stuff too. Yeah, the 1800 Agent got me out to help a client, but also failed to schedule a 2nd job for another agent to go out and do Home Theater stuff.

Total tech; Hello I have an issue with my total tech. It was set to renew and did but somehow it was cancelled from Bestbuy side and cancelled all my warranties on the products I bought in the past. If I buy now they say it will not cover previous items which were covered and would apply to future products only. I went to the store they referred me to their phone number. Their phone number and chat keep deferring me to other departments here and there and 3hrs + I have NOT gotten anywhere! Anyone have any advice?,10usgg4
Go in the store when people are actually working inconsiderate human,j7eyzzt
There's nothing you can do. You can't re add warranties after they've been cancelled. The help line and in store staff will keep you running in circles just to pass you off. This is why Total tech is a joke. So any 3 or 5 year plans you had are meaningless now and void.,j7dsa6j
"We don't cancel things automatically what sense is that? Your card probably expired. If it was recently call 1888bestbuy and update it, it might fix it.",j7ewze9
Come in store and make someone's day by telling them you want to renew and add that all of your stuff is no longer protected. A manager will have no problem re-adding all protection plans on your items upon re upgrading!!!,j7gshbd
"The total tech membership is only cancelled two ways. If you call and cancel or if your card on file is expired, or failed authorization. In both of those cases you will receive an email stating so. It usually stays in failed authorization for 30 days after those 30 days it goes into lapsed status. When it has lapsed there is nothing more that can be done. A new membership can be purchased but the protection plans can not be activated again. You as the customer have to keep up with your cards. If you get a new one or your bank blocks the charge. You are responsible not BestBuy.",j7kzvcc
Thanks for replying! Everything was purchased within last year! Still nothing can be done?,j7dyp7q
Are you being sarcastic or serious? I went in and the manager said he can sell me another membership but my previous items would not be added. Should I try another Best Buy?,j7ilhc5
Unfortunately what happened was I called to return a rower and the rep on the phone cancelled the TT membership instead. I noticed immediately and have been calling and going to stores but no one is restoring. ü§¨,j7mdknf
Awesome answer and absolutely correct!!!,j99zqfu
I was being serious. Mind you we are not supposed to be doing that but it is manager discression. DM me,j7j1kn4

I don‚Äôt think so I‚Äôve heard some serious horror stories about it,j77a90c
"It's mostly customer service, if you enjoy helping people it's great",j77fffs
"If you like helping people and explaining basic computer concepts to people, sometimes repeatedly, then it's nice. There's definitely more tedious work out there and it can feel nice to help people out. Just be sure that you're a-ok with customer service bs. But working around computers in an air conditioned store ain't all that bad",j7a3bit
I tried so many times and they didn‚Äôt called me back. Also I heard that unless you are not recommended by someone you don‚Äôt get the job,j7b3bsn
Do you want to work as a Geek Squad Agent in store or in the field???,j7bcs4f
If it was still ran under Huber Jolie I would say go for it but that company is being ran into the ground absolutely would not recommend it anymore,j81lv4o
"Is it GeekSquad in the store or in the field? They are totally different in terms of work, pay, autonomy and pretty much everything.",j8bow8v
"Do it! I enjoy my job. It‚Äôs hard work, but it‚Äôs rewarding. You get to travel around town, every day is something new, and you won‚Äôt be working overnights. Give it a shot.",jal67wg
"Hey, if you're still thinking about this and it's an opportunity then yes. If you're in school and you're thinking about going into IT you should say yes and apply and try for it. Work for Geek Squad and it doesn't matter which position, get some IT experience and even if you dislike it for a little while, you then have the opportunity to learn great customer service/communication skills, along with IT skills. Once you're ready to move on from Geek Squad, look for an IT job somewhere else at a different company. You'll get paid much more. I worked at a computer sales associate and then went to mobile and then to advanced repair agent in Geek Squad. After a year, I found a much better job that pays salary with full benefits and unlimited PTO in IT utilizing what I learned in Geek Squad and the job is actually tremendously easier than Geek Squad.     Just my advice if you're still considering it or if this is even still an opportunity for you after it's been 2 months.",je5kstf
I wonder if it‚Äôs like that everywhere. I appreciate the heads up,j7b3scc
I honestly don‚Äôt even know. Geek squad seemed like the best for me because I hate interacting with people but it sounds like that‚Äôs what it mostly is anyway.,j7e2gx2
In store,j8dhhfi
I tried multiple Best Buy‚Äôs but you can try it out might be like that were I live,j7b4btz
For my store the managers basically choose they‚Äôre favorite normal sales associates and promote them to geek squad if they want it.,j96vv84
Then geek squad is not for u!! You definitely must work with customers and provide a1 services as well as offer TT services and customers are often upset more with gs and cs In store for computer repair issues‚Ä¶ failing to schedule appointments‚Ä¶. As well as rapid exchanges not being so ‚Äúrapid‚Äù as a former mod I‚Äôve delt with escalated customers on that side daily.,j9a09o6

There‚Äôs a team at 888-BESTBUY that deals with lost orders. I don‚Äôt believe the store can help with that because there is a strict system in place to handle those claims at a corporate level. I‚Äôd make sure to call during daytime business hours to get the best chance of speaking to someone stateside.,j5xgl06

Thoughts on store leadership blatantly disregarding VPL SOP; It seems like a common thing for BBY Store leadership to not even care about VPL SOP at all. Speaking as a former T Mobile VPL and soon to be former ATT VPL. Similar experiences at all? Scrolled through the handbook today and was amazed at all the extra work I've been doing.,10i9ao0
This is why Best Buy is losing these VPL positions. Doesn‚Äôt want to invest in their own workers and tries to lean too hard on the labor agreements they‚Äôve made with their vendors. Now those decisions are coming back to bite Best Buy.  Really wonder how long it‚Äôll be before they lose Microsoft or any of the HT VPL spots.,j5d9754
Yeah my store doesn‚Äôt respect the VPL rules at all. They just treat them like regular salespeople and make them lie to their vendor about what work they‚Äôre actually doing,j5d6n6v
"My God our microsoft vpl was such a pretentious ass....   Bs about them giving you work that isn't actually your responsibility though, I remember losing a few vpls that just got sick of more or less being treated like standard team members",j5e0row
"I understand and respect the concept of VPL Team Members.  However.... a majority of Customers don't know VPL roles even exist and don't know how differentiate between VPLs and non-VPLs.   To Customers, a Blue Shirt is a Blue Shirt, even if there is extra Brand embroidery on that Blue Shirt.  If I'm the only non-VPL person in a 100 foot radius with a line of Customers 4+ deep and there are two or more VPLs visible only 20 feet away just chatting amongst themselves, they should proactively help the non-VPL associate in assisting that line of Customers.   Greet the Customers, show them the products, answer their questions... Hell, they can even ring out the Customers by adding a non-VPL Associate's numbers on the POS to the transaction.  If VPLs don't/won't help when it's obvious their assistance is needed, THEY are the assholes.   Yes... I am speaking from first-hand experience.  Yes... I get salty every time I think about it.",j5jqsca
The vpls are actually able to assist customers that are not specific to their brand that clause was edited a while ago which was the reason for the blue shirt merge just a magnolia associates however the goal is to be brand specific first . Ex‚Ä¶. If u have customers that want lg service them first as an lg rep but if u have no customers then the next one is yours ! U can never tell a cx oh I only work with lg I use to tell my reps and sales people if the cx wants brand specific help and it‚Äôs not your brand talk to them as much as you can until that rep is freed up if u r free! The only way to build a winning team is to work together!,j9a186v
I‚Äôm connected car vpl and that‚Äôs where I second the least of my time .,jd0weby
"You understand that it's actually against SOP to ring someone up under another employees numbers? And that isn't even for VPLs only.   Let it be known, I have always done my non VPL duties, however when leadership blatantly disregards the SOP in place it creates a Grey area or a ""where do we draw the line"" scenario. I don't have an issue with doing truck. Or doing a code one. But it literally isn't in my job description, so I should either be getting paid more to take on extra duties and responsibilities, or they shouldn't have VPLs breaking SOP only when it benefits them.",j5js2mj
Mobile VPLs are literally only supposed to sell product that can be tied into a phone purchase or anything of the like.,j5jsr96
"The problem with this is that if I go and start answering questions and a customer walks up to the my products table, I am unable to do my actual job bc I am working for another company for no reason. Your probably should be with Best Buy jot properly staffing their stores, not VPL's getting dragged into doing work outside their job description",jarfpzw
Edited my comment to having an Associate's numbers *added* to the transaction *with the VPLs* so there is accurate tracking.  I agree: Where do both parties draw the line?  Assisting customers when non-VPLs are overwhelmed is on the right side of that line.,j5jvw7l
Customers literally could not care less when they are waiting for assistance and a Blue Shirt who is not with a customer refuses to help them.,j5jweo5
"I understand that aspect. My post isn't complaining about customers at all. I've never denied a customer assistance. I've always either answered their questions the best I could, or hand them off to a coworker from said department.  The main take away from this post is that leadership disregards SOP when it benefits them and offloads extra responsibilities onto VPLs.",j5k65rh

"VPL SOP means nothing to leadership; I became the LG HT VPL for my store back in October. Since then, I‚Äôve been treated like just another advisor, along with my Sony and Samsung VPLs who also got promoted in October. I understand that help is needed through the store in other departments but my issue is that leadership sees it as an ‚Äúexpectation‚Äù that we flex to help. SOP clearly states that VPLs cannot be used as coverage for other departments. ‚ÄúBuT wE‚ÄôrE nOt HiTtInG gOaLs‚Äù Okay? That doesn‚Äôt mean they can just ignore policy. When it was brought up that we weren‚Äôt happy about SOP being ignored, they basically told us to deal with it. But when it came to me taking an hour lunch rather than 45 minutes, guess what I was told? SOP clearly states we are only allowed 45 minutes. Funny how SOP only matters when it benefits the leaders and not the employees that the leaders have to rely on in the first place to even help make them look good. I applied for this position so that I could have specific responsibilities and I haven‚Äôt been able to do them. My vendor pad is basically an afterthought. And when I take it upon myself to follow SOP and stay in my department, I become the bad guy.",10d2uum
"They‚Äôre doing the same thing at my store. My Verizon VPL pulled SOP on them and refused to move around, eventually he quit because he got tired of the BS.   This is Best Buy under Corie Barry: overworked and paid barely the same (actually less if you adjust for inflation), covering areas of the store they‚Äôve run with a skeleton crew if they staff it at all (looking at you SPU and CS; one person calls out and suddenly we‚Äôre throwing salespeople up there). And speaking of sales, even with VPL ‚Äúflexing‚Äù around the store we‚Äôre still getting holes stared through us by impatient customers because two advisors called out.  I‚Äôve been here a long time and I know the post holidays labor cuts are normal but we haven‚Äôt even dropped our seasonals yet and we‚Äôre already short staffed. The situation now is definitely worse than pre-COVID.",j4m9jsk
You need to get solid proof and take it to HR. No other way. Make sure you send copies of everything including the SOP.,j4jgh4w
"My store does that exact same thing with me and my other mobile VPLs. We had 2 Verizon VPLs, 1 tmobile and 1 at&t but they cut the tmobile role and will be cutting the at&t one on the 29th. My at&t rep always tries to bring up SOP on that and their argument was that you cant just sit in mobile and wait for customers to come to you, you have to meet customers in other departments and convince them they need a new phone or carrier etc. Then wanna wonder why they keep having non VPL employees doing activations and other mobile transactions. Which leads to loss for the store cause they were never actually trained in mobile well and make mistakes.",j4lawkg
Coming from a former VPL and supervisor. Yeah they don‚Äôt give a fuck about VPL SOP.,j61rt6m

"And like I said, I understand that help is needed in other departments but it technically isn‚Äôt our problem due to our titles. I still wouldn‚Äôt mind helping out my peers but when the leaders make it seem like it‚Äôs still my actual responsibility to flex over, that‚Äôs my issue. I can literally refuse to go help and say no if I want to. And they also always say if you‚Äôre not with a customer, you need to be putting totes away, like no, I don‚Äôt need to be.",j4lfyin
Am I in the wrong?; So some back ground there‚Äôs a sup at my store who hasn‚Äôt liked me since I got hired.  The other day I was told by my Asm that I was staying until 9 to close with her the sup.  But then as 8pm rolled around the sup tells me I‚Äôm not staying that someone from warehouse is‚Ä¶ok no big deal I walk over to my Asm and tell her so and so is staying to close so I was going to leave once I pulled the registers.  She asks over the mic what time so and so leaves and the sup responds with 9pm that they‚Äôre closing the store and doing a walk.  And then the sup comes up to me and says I need to quit playing mom and dad with  them‚Ä¶..   The only time I‚Äôve had to play ‚Äúmom and dad‚Äù is when she the sup tells me how to do something and it doesn‚Äôt work so I say that didn‚Äôt work and the response is always it did‚Ä¶. So I have to run around the store to get an answer???,10d1dj8
Your sup sounds immature. Nothing wrong with letting the ASM know what‚Äôs going on so you don‚Äôt get in trouble for leaving earlier than they told you.,j4ki3g4

It sucks but that's the name of the game in retail these days. Not saying it's right but things are only gonna get worse me thinks,j4iie0x
Honestly it might just be me but does anyone else feel the company is loosing so much revenue with TT with labor they would have otherwise sold? This is going to be the killer of Best Buy. I‚Äôve done so many installs that would have brought the company 3-4x the income but they had TT and it was all free. That‚Äôs great for the customer but with that being said not so good if we all are spread thin and we‚Äôre dealing with even more impatient customers with hours disappearing.,j4lpyxk

"In addition, the phone service schedules jobs as free even though it's not covered because their only metric is how quickly they can get off the phone. They will also schedule jobs as residential and covered under a personal TT even though it's obviously a commercial job or schedule at a family member or even friend's house that is not covered. Products we don't support or sell have been scheduled for install or support. The stores and senior sales aren't much better at times. It's a mess.   I've been on a few jobs where Best Buy lost $1,400 to $3,200 in labor due to this and management has erred on the side of customer satisfaction because the job was already scheduled.",j8dqk78

"It's a competitive advantage compared to other retailers. Memberships tend to create more sales and Costco isn't going to mount that new TV. If scheduling and routing worked logically and how they should the system would break even or even make a profit but the ""everything is free"" mentality and ""client satisfaction"" at all costs turns the program into a financial drag. Don't forget, everyone is supposed to sell so field agents are expected to pay for themselves with their revenue so in theory TT is also free labor for the company.",j8dy7hb
"4 Leaders to watch cameras. 4 associates to run sales floor.; Looked up to the front of store yesterday to see all 4 of my leaders crowded around watching cameras together, while our total of 4 sales associates worked. Why did we need EVERYONE on the leadership team doing the same job?",10brc4f
The fact that we have more managers on the floor than sales reps most says is mind boggling and then all they do is pass the customers over to us as if we don't already have 5 customers waiting on us smh üòí,j4e78p8
I remember working AP and the management wouldn‚Äôt let anyone up to talk to me. Simple questions were fine but the moment an employee or customer would be there for a second longer than it should have taken I‚Äôd get called out on the radio. Now managers make it a hang out up there. Interesting how that works.,j4lqdag

"Certain things that they don't want the rest of the store to know about could result in that. Also, only like 2 of the computers in the store have access to cams.

"AT&T VPL Position Removal; I initially started working at Best Buy earlier last year. I started off as a T-Mobile VPL. After some time the T-mobile position was removed. I was laid off, with the option to apply for the AT T VPL position, or any other position available that I may want in the store, and offered a month of severance while waiting ot looking for a new job.   Fast forward to now, I have just found out now that the AT&T VPL position is going to be removed.  This time, there is no offer of severance, and I am left with the choice to apply for the open Verizon VPL position, or step down to part time and move to a different department.   Are there any other VPL workers experiencing this? If so, is the offer you're receiving or the process similar?  It's frustrating that both of my positions within the company will have been terminated soon.",103bmqk

Preach!,ixf48vw
"I am in agreement!  It is very telling how badly workers have been groomed to default to freaking out and attacking one another on topics like this.  The folks that start calling for fellow humans to just ""work or leave"" have been lost to us and go out of their way to viciously defend corp and store leadership.  If they put that same energy into standing in solidarity with their fellow workers, we wouldn't even need a walkout of any kind.  Because if we did stand together we could actually be at the table.    I have had some very good times and met lots of friends and other cool people at BBY.  It has had times where they showed attempts at good-faith employee relations.  Also the point of said walkout is about those of us that actually care about making the company better.  The bootlickers yell ""don't like it, then leave!"" shit as if just finding a new job is like buying candy, and like we shouldn't be treated like humans.  Doing something like a walkout or forming a union is all what happens when the ""correct"" channels are taken but ignored.  They do so much that just counteracts everything we are constantly told.  We are the ones that have to deal with any and all customer/client rage and confusion that comes from badly setup ideas changing in ways that go against how large chunks of said shoppers/clients expect things.  Corp will just keep bad ideas going even if it is painfully obvious that it isn't working.  The folks that seem to make the plans are all super disconnected from the real world and real people (and I imagine they just want to speed up the latter fast enough to not be the one to deal with blow back).  If the stuff isn't working based on back and white metrics, it is us that are surely the issue and not their ""amazing idea"".    The current setup is based on trying to make more and more money than the record breaking years of 2020 and 2021 isn't sustainable.  Those years shouldn't be used in the same way that normal years are.  Sales went nuts because all of a sudden so many people had to quickly get or upgrade stuff to simply keep working and/or going to school.  Much like how so many streaming services are seeing big drops in subs.  Of course more people will sign up for streaming media when they can't go places like they normally would.

"also means that projections for those services shouldn't keep planning for those numbers to keep growing instead of dropping.  So we see budgets slashed, things canceled, and lots and lots of workers laid off in desperate efforts to make the numbers look like things are still booming from a shareholders standpoint.  Which can only work for so long (especially if top people keep giving themselves higher and higher bonuses) before everything just falls apart dramatically.   If we didn't care, then obviously we would just leave.  We need things to be done in ways that work for both workers and the top.  If they are going to keep forcing us to watch lame elearnings about ""mental health importance"" and ""really caring about respecting each other"".  Then they could also start doing stuff that materially impacts workers lives in positive ways.  The ""customer obsession and building relationships"" nonsense is completely undermined by running everything so super lean in all departments.  Leaders freak the hell out if even two people are in a line, and just drag others that are already helping in some way into it.  But they could've allowed more people to be helped by getting in there and doing it themselves.  All that running around to find someone is time they could've just did it.  I hope that the stores that were the starting point of this walkout go through with it and in big numbers (I may if it happens in my area).  They can fire us all, but at a certain point it bites them hard if they were to do so.  All the extra and useless stuff needed to train new people has gotten so bad in some departments that it couldn't be done fast enough.    We just want respect and not constant gaslighting with threats that go along with it.  We want to not be doing all the jobs at the same time (especially when it is stuff that is outside our capacity).  The company used to have people that knew shit about their departments and could really answer questions or give advice to customers/clients.

Tell me you don't understand the first amendment without telling me you don't understand the first amendment...,ixg6kvg
This wasn‚Äôt my idea in the first place. I‚Äôm just spreading the message. They‚Äôre stores already planning to do this. They need more to join in to make it affective. Best Buy claims they want to be the best place to work but they‚Äôre not even close.,ixdbgae

"Warehouse; I‚Äôm 6‚Äô3 250 and this week and half of last week I‚Äôve been being forced to do more of a warehouse type job by my self and I‚Äôm supposed to be upfront, should I be worried about them transferring me to warehouse or just hope this is only for Black Friday.

You can choose where you want to work through the app and you must have done the learnings to have been scheduled in that department,ixb7bg8
Warehouse is easy,ixbeta4
"Schedule Question; Is there a way to check a store wide schedule? I want to see who else is working during my shift and if I should expect to be alone or not. Is there a way to check this, or are you only able to see your own schedule?",yzicds
In TLC under reports you can see either the daily or weekly schedule report.   Without being in the store I don't think there's a way to do so.,ix0dp6u

"It really doesn't matter where you are. They are going to care about your signups and your TT's no matter what. Especially front lanes for signups. If you are seasonal I wouldnt worry about it, but if you are part time it is nice to be able to work in all departments and have the knowledge. From someone who's seen people who are one trick ponies in front lanes/ customer service please don't be afraid to stretch your legs and learn as much as you can.",iwk28nj
Slim to none man. I was with the company for 11-years in a variety of different roles (sales-management) the narrow focus is on memberships regardless what department you‚Äôre in. Your only chance at working at BBY and not having to shill your soul away for memberships is to go into warehouse position asap.  Honest recommendation. Jump ship. Company is bleeding and purging employees yearly to justify poor decisions coming from upper level management.,iwn24w0
But if you really truly like only working in front lanes then theres no hurt in asking your supervisor and seeing what they say,iwk2b24
My bestbuy doesn‚Äôt care about the cashiers at all they over staff it and don‚Äôt even realize who‚Äôs up front or not I‚Äôve talked to some of the cashiers and they said that they have only sold 2 credit cards in like 8 months because they are so focused on the sales floor,iwnipy5
"E learnings at home?; I got hired and had a 4 hour shift of just doing e learnings. I wasnt able to finish and still have about 3 hours left, but my next shift isnt until a week later. My leader mentioned that I can do the e learnings at home if I want as long as I record my hours, but when I check the TLC there's no log to put in the hours for e learnings. Do I just clock in from home and do it? Or should I just wait until my shifts and expect them to pull me aside to finish them?  I have a friend who worked retail (@ Target) and he told me that they pulled him aside for 1 hour during his shifts just to work on the e learnings, and I was expecting the same for BestBuy. But when the leader mentioned doing it at home, I got confused as to whether they expect you to do it on your own or at work. I just don't want to clock in from home and then get in trouble for doing so. (I'm not even sure if you can clock in from home, I havent pressed the button cause I don't even know if it'll let me and I don't wanna screw up anything.)",yw5weg
So basically you just do them at home and then the next time you‚Äôre at work you can edit your time sheet and log the hours you spent working on them manually,iwhu7jf
How would I edit the time sheet? When I go into the TLC I don‚Äôt see anything like that. Sorry for the dumb questions,iwhuke8
"All good, ask away! In TLC there‚Äôs a button that says ‚Äúview my time sheet‚Äù and then from there you can add manual punches for ‚Äúclock on‚Äù and ‚Äúclock off‚Äù and just enter the time you started and the time you finished doing e learnings",iwhussk
Thank you so much!,iwhuz02
You‚Äôre welcome!,iwhv759
Keep in mind they CAN check how long u were doing e-learning on that day and how many u get done. They can also see if u set on any idle to long or anything like that. So make sure u are actually doing them.  U can also call ur mgr and ask if u can come in for another short shift in next couple days to complete e-learnings. They will usually let u.,iwjm5pw
Do I have to do the video interview multiple times?; I applied to multiple Best Buys and got multiple video interview invites but do I have to redo the interview over and over or can I do one and the rest get the same video?,yub7qv

Looking to get a job; I‚Äôm looking to start working at Best Buy soon and was wondering if you guys had any advice/tips ETC. I‚Äôll be working in the southeast and have a decent amount of experience in retail,yuacvb
"The advice really depends on what you‚Äôre going for. Are you looking to work on the sales floor, in the warehouse or at Geek Squad? The only tip I‚Äôll add that‚Äôs generic is don‚Äôt waste too much time with this company: if you don‚Äôt advance within a few years it‚Äôs likely going to be more effective to get hired on someplace else and use your experience at Best Buy as a selling point to your next employer. The worst mistake you can make is to spend a decade in a line level position where your tenure is a bigger problem than for a new hire.",iw8l4tv

"Don‚Äôt listen to this guy, I work there and the team environment is outstanding everyone stands around talking to each other and let‚Äôs the antisocial people ring up the customers. You‚Äôll enjoy Best Buy as long as you aren‚Äôt antisocial and you actually enjoy technology",iw9vtz5
"For sales be prepared to show an enthusiasm for technology, explain how you keep up with the newest tech (do you follow influencers like MKBHD, Linus, etc). Obviously if you have any personal experience doing PC building, home theater setups, etc I‚Äôd mention that too and try to work it into conversation.   Be aware that they were/are still doing recorded video interviews and some of the questions can be tricky. Luckily you should be able to re-record your answer if you don‚Äôt feel like you did good with it.   There are also ethical questions typically designed to trip up dishonest or otherwise unethical people. They tend to be presented as multiples choice questions, where there‚Äôs an answer that might be reasonable but only one actual ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù answer.   At any rate, good luck. :) As long as you‚Äôre coming in with no expectations of advancement or long term stability you should be fine.",iw8uzjq
bro thinks this is about being anti social üíÄ it‚Äôs about doing absolutely ridiculous shit for 15.50 an hour. unrealistic expectations and understaffed asf   also managers who hide in SDR and people like u who stand around and talk and do nothing. but everyone has different experiences so oh well,iwaae4v

Can I get fired for talking about pay?; I told a coworker several weeks ago that I was going to ask for a raise. I told them that I had an idea in mind of what I was going to ask for well I got the raise plus more I told the coworker today that I got the raise they asked how much and I said it's more than what I asked for and she said that she'd be talking to management about it. Am I in the wrong?,yoa9td
Nope. Your allowed to talk to anyone about pay. Management can get pissy about if they want but can't do anything.,ivd83be
"It's against the law to prevent you from talking about pay. The very fact that you feel awkward about doing this is a prime reason WHY there's a law that protects doing so. Like others have said, you do have to be careful about whom you share pay information with and large companies have enough impossible-to-follow regulations that terminating you for talking about pay can be legally excused as something else, but until the culture of silence changes and workers organize and stand up for themselves, it will only get worse and cold-blooded executives like Corie Barry will reap huge personal fortunes while grinding both employees and the company itself into nothing.      It sounds like your ""friend"" is a lazy person who demands special treatment already and your management most likely sees her work assignment as fitting compensation for her job performance, no matter how much longer she's been there than you. She can't do anything to you officially, but you may want to distance yourself from her as she may allow her frustration to motivate her to file false things about you, and if I read you correctly, she's already threatening you for making more. Use this interaction as a personal growth opportunity for you. Especially when you haven't done anything wrong, there are some people who aren't happy unless everyone else is miserable.",ivrmg0h
Yes.  But you shouldn‚Äôt,ive3wex
"You‚Äôre allowed to talk about pay, it‚Äôs a protected concerted activity as defined in the National Labor Relations Act (even for places that aren‚Äôt unionized). When your coworker said she‚Äôd be talking to management about it, did she say it in a negative way? Like, did she maybe mean she was gonna ask for her own raise? It‚Äôs shitty if she‚Äôs trying to make it a negative thing, but you‚Äôve done nothing wrong.",ivdecyy
"If you are told to not talk about pay at a job, turn around. It's illegal. It's not your fault you aren't paid even wages, it's the employers. They sign the checks, and for them to say ""don't talk a about pay"" is covering themselves from the whole store walking out because they get paid less than a new hire.(I was a whole dollar paid more than a veteran employee at Best Buy for almost a year. I was upset that management did that for two guys in the same job.",iygud8o
"Ok,it‚Äôs just concerning because I apparently make more than them  and they‚Äôre so pissed when I‚Äôve been there less time.",ivd8e9y
"In the store I worked all management did was stand by the front door and browbeat sales to push total tech, branded payments and credit programs. They would have to deal with an occasional pissed off customer, a good floor sales person is far more valuable and deserves more money.",ivdauje
She said it like she was trying to get rid of me,ivdgm1u
That would be why management will say not to talk about it. But that employee now has every reason to go talk to them. Of course there can be factors like experience where a newer employee can make more than another. But i get that employee being mad they make less now,ivd8kly
"It's a taboo thing to do that people need to get over. I'm a truck driver for a small fleet, we have a warehouse and warehouse workers. I make $30/hr plus im guaranteed 40 hours paid every week regardless if I work a single day that week or not, that is the complete opposite for those warehouse workers and I would never speak about my pay to them unless they asked and wanted to know how to get their CDL. Generally speaking, in the type of setting your in, it's best not to talk about it and just enjoy it, they might be your co-workers but they can very easily be your biggest adversaries or something has a petty as pay. You'll probably hear about it from management though ü§£",iveqxir
"People are right, that no they can't fire you for talking about pay, you most likely live in an At-Will state, and they can fire you for any reason that isn't protected. These companies are usually smart enough to have so many policies and procedures that everyone is breaking some minor rule on any given day. So they can just say they fired you for reason X, even though it was probably because you were talking about pay.",ivhluf2
Well that won‚Äôt work out for her the way she‚Äôs thinking and it‚Äôs really shortsighted when she should just go for a raise herself. I hate coworkers who treat their peers like enemies. But at least you know not to talk about pay (and tread carefully on other topics) with that specific coworker. Or at least only let them tell you what they earn but don‚Äôt reciprocate.,ivdkbej
And part of the reason I‚Äôm sure I make more is because I‚Äôm on the sales floor/warehouse/customer service and all she does is customer service and refuses to do anything else,ivd8rxc
Could be a factor. All are same pay grade. Which is only about w dollar difference between starting and cap.,ivd8vos

what does open box mean and should i buy excellent condition?; What does Open box excellent condition imply Question Hey so there is a laptop available with 100 dollars less on openbox excellent but no idea of buying before and can't return it since going to get it in my country through a friend so therefore should i go for it or dish out 100 usd more,yj60zs
What laptop is it???  Open box means that someone bought it and returned it within 14 days. Geek squad looked it over and found it to be in ‚Äúexcellent ‚Äú condition. Which means nothing is wrong with it. But how long has it been on the shelf? Is it an older version of the processor or is it a new computer??,iumtryi

It‚Äôs a good computer. It has a good processor. It is however a gaming computer but you can still use it for day to day operations. It‚Äôs only downfall is that it has limited memory for a really good gaming computer but it‚Äôs fine for most games and for day to day stuff. Good price. Most computers like this can also have the hard drive and ram upgraded pretty easily too.,iun8ra9

Just got hired; I just got hired on to be a part time sales associate what can I expect? Also how many hours does part time typically work per shift?,yi0dl4
Can vary wildly from store to store but during the holidays you can probably expect nearly FT hours. Otherwise it‚Äôs typically a couple 8 hour shifts or 3-4 4 hour shifts with some weeks being a mix of the two depending on what coverage they need.,iui3iep

"Supposed to be 15 minutes for every four hours typically. But as already said, it can vary by state/city law. I know SOP says/said ‚Äúsubject to business conditions‚Äù or some such but in some states that‚Äôs irrelevant: breaks are mandatory and can‚Äôt be denied (subject to whatever timing the state/city provides).   In Washington state, for example, you‚Äôd get a minimum ten minute break in the first 3 hours of your 6 hour shift and an unpaid 30 minute lunch at the midpoint of your shift but no later than 5 hours into your shift.",is8nrvx
"How can I get feedback for a failed application?; I was offered an interview, and then was told Best Buy wouldn‚Äôt be moving forward with my application. Is there anywhere I can contact for feedback or is anyone currently working there willing to help out?",y1psff
"Best Buy has a strict policy, very rigid and straight from legal, that feedback is not given out to failed applicants, under any circumstance. I think it‚Äôs less a legal thing than a brand thing, but you absolutely will not get this feedback. It sucks, but also I have never met a corporation that does this.  ALSO‚Ä¶be glad. Best Buy is and has been a sinking ship and it‚Äôs a super shitty place to work. So‚Ä¶bullet dodged! Go find a good place to work.",irzzkai

Nope,irrsuuk
What should i expect from video interview?; I applied for job at local best buy. And couple days later i got an email about video interview. What should i expect? Is it interview with recruiting team or just myself talking to screen. What question i should prepared for?  Thanks,xwbtt4
It‚Äôs just you recording yourself answering their questions no other person that‚Äôs how it was for me. As for the questions it‚Äôs gonna be typical interview questions about why you wanna work there and what you can bring to the team .,ir7cx0u
"As the other person said, it‚Äôs just you recording videos of yourself answering the questions. You do only get **one shot** to record them, so make sure you‚Äôve got a quiet place to record.

You‚Äôll see questions like:  - What‚Äôs got you excited about working at Best Buy? - What‚Äôs a time you made a change in your workplace, and how did you know it had an impact?

Employee discount; I‚Äôve worked at Best Buy for 2 years now. I‚Äôve been trying to get the employee discount on the Best Buy app but it won‚Äôt let me. I‚Äôve signed in to ETK on it and the app. Can anyone help me. Or is there another app I should use?,xl74rb
"You have to do it from the Personal tab in ETK. From there you pair it to your dotcom account. Then when you sign in to dotcom it‚Äôll prompt you for your aID after you log in (sometimes if you‚Äôre already signed in, just adding something to your cart and going to check out will force it to prompt, then you can return to your cart to start seeing prices). If you log out and back in you‚Äôll have to confirm your aID again (or sometimes if you sign in on a mobile device and then use a computer like a desktop or laptop it‚Äôll force you to confirm your aID).

Thing is this happened around April of this year and at that time I told my ASM he just told me to download Credit Karma and check.

"Managers not letting me quit??; So I've been dealing with a really weird situation recently. For background, I'm a college student in my late 20's. Been working in retail for nearly a decade. I didn't finish my bachelor's when I was younger, but I went back to school last year to finish my degree so I don't have to work retail for the rest of my life. I am in a fortunate position with scholarships and financial aid that I don't necessarily need to work while I'm in school, but I thought I'd stick with Best Buy for a little extra cash and for the employee discount.  &#x200B;  When my current semester started a couple of weeks ago I quickly realized that my homework and assigned readings are going to be far more time-consuming than previous semesters. So a week and a half ago I informed my GM that I was giving my two weeks notice so I could focus exclusively on my studies. He basically disregarded me and said I'd have to speak with my immediate supervisor, who was on vacation at the time. The following week I had to call off on truck night because I had too much homework, and my ASM manager calls me saying I need to manage my time better and that they'll just schedule me for less shifts or on different days. And like the GM, he just ignored that fact that I said I'm quitting and continued to schedule me.  &#x200B;  Then when I was working this weekend, my ASM again tried to talk to me about my schedule in a very manipulative way, ignoring me when I say I'm quitting and continuing to talk about just working less hours or staying on as occasional/seasonal. I finally had to assert myself and clearly confirm that I am quitting. Then I ask to confirm that my last shift will be in the coming week, and my ASM says, ""No, you just gave your two-week notice, so you will have to work two more weeks,"" completely ignoring the fact that I had already given my two-week notice to the GM more than a week previous. On this same shift I'm dealing with the usual understaffing that my store and every other store has been dealing with. For the final two-thirds of my 9.5-hour shift I was the only product flow employee in the store. I was so stressed out during that shift that I was seriously considering walking",xcctn9
"flow employee in the store. I was so stressed out during that shift that I was seriously considering walking out mid-shift and never coming back. I did finish my shift, but there is no way in hell I'm staying with this company.  &#x200B;  Since my managers will not listen to me, I am seriously considering just employing the quitting-by-not-showing-up method, which is not something I ever thought I'd do, but what other choice do I have?",xcctn9
"You should write or type a job abandonment letter ASAP. I‚Äôd take a pic of it before you turn that in. It doesn‚Äôt need to be fancy, just make sure it has your name clearly printed on it. Personally, I‚Äôd write something about how you attempted to put it in with the GM on whatever date that was. Take a pic of it.   Turn it in to the GM directly if possible. ASM if GM is unavailable.   That way no matter what, if your anyone of them gets crappy, send them the screenshot.   At that point IF you ever want to be considered for possible employment in the future I‚Äôd call HR and file a complaint. Your store probably has job termination forms already printed out that you SHOULD have been given the first time you said you wanted to leave.   Most GMs would have immediately offered to move you to OS or just schedule you less. Most want to help with school. I‚Äôve seen one schedule someone for a day in a month. Not sure why yours are being so shifty and refusing to acknowledge the fact that you‚Äôre about to leave.",io4gnnc
Write your two weeks notice letter with the last day you intend to work.  EMAIL it to the GM/ASM and district manager.  State why you are sending it.  Because no one would listen to you.

5 years?; I‚Äôm about to come up to my 5 year mark at Best Buy. Some of my seniors have told me you get some kind of reward or gift? Has this happened to anyone else?,x1ofw2
Yes I chose the store gift card instead,imeuh0c

What‚Äôs on there changes as when I did it there were scooters but last time I saw they removed them.   Edit to add kinds of gifts",imfljq4

Did Best Buy just dump 1.7M in Office Activation Codes?,x0qutw
"EDIT: Reddit wouldn't let me embed image in post.  Hey, So I work frequently with Best Buy on their liquidation end, and I sometimes see some crazy, (and sketchy shit). I'd like a employees perspective, so I got some questions..  I stumbled across a lot with 18K 2019 Office Activation cards. Now, after doing some research, these cards are not activated until purchased. So is Best Buy trying to pawn off useless plastic cards or are these cards actually activated?  **The lot is already ended so this information will in no way benefit anyone. I am just curious if I dodged a train or roughly $1.7M in Microsoft office suites?**  The reason I ask is Best Buy has ""accidently"" sold many lots of product that ""shouldn't"" have been sold to the public liquidators. I have seen recalled product, RMA product, Non-operational floor models and among other things.",im9hjkg
"IIRC the cards have a ‚Äúvalue‚Äù associated with them, and $1 seems completely reasonable. But no, it‚Äôs very likely those cards are just worthless.",imayjqx
I appreciate the info. Best Buy often throws a random number for MSRP so $1 is really not their approximated value. They often list inventory at $0-1 as a placeholder when there are special conditions.      What value would you associate with IIRC cards?     As an FYI this lot sold at $.89 a unit roughly.,imbmje3
"Sorry, IIRC = if I recall correctly   Whoever paid money for that is gonna be really disappointed. Those cards don‚Äôt even have a spot for a scratch off code to even try to get lucky. They‚Äôre literally a card with a UPC and product information. The actual code is generated and either sent via email, printed on the receipt, or both.",imbn8q4

Questions about online interview; So I did the online interview about 5 days ago am I supposed to get any email confirming that it has been turned in it‚Äôs been on my mind the past few days it said everything was submitted and that I can close the page but I haven‚Äôt received any emails at all and wonder if I did something wrong.,wylhu9

"Shipt orders; Hey BestBuy workers,   I work for Shipt which in many areas handles your deliveries. What happens to the returns/not able to be delivered orders?   Because Shipt just has us tell them the name of the employee that we handed it to and that‚Äôs it. There‚Äôs no scanning or verification and with other stores undeliverable orders sometimes Shipt just tells us to keep it or the store managers tell us that.",wxixwd
The store has to check it in on there end.,ilr8yro
Interesting cause Shipt tells us to ‚Äúreturn it at your earliest convenience‚Äù which to me seems like the Shipt worker could hold onto it for a long time without consequence.,ilrlj2l
If the store sees its suppose to be checked back in and it's not within probably a day they can report it to higher ups.,ilrloxg

They had every right to call the cops. He was told to leave he refused so now he is trespassing. It was obvious he was there to just waste time.,il6ieua
"The minute you refuse to leave, you are trespassing. He was also recording in store without permission and clearly wasting GS's time and as you all know, time is something we don't have while at work at Best Buy.",il70131

I would double down on the clown and charge him ie. Check product in hold it a week and say we couldn't fix it,il9wttw
"I know I'm probably going to get downvoted for this, but here we fuckin' go  What these kids did wrong wasn't the recording but refusing to leave once being asked to. Hear me out here, bestbuy is open to everyone without any need of like a membership (like costco) or express permission of the building owner (like a key to open the door) to enter like most businesses.  The right to privacy in the US is pretty much this;""It is not illegal to record someone without their consent in a public place if they are visible and audible, especially if they don‚Äôt have reasonable expectations of privacy. But in a private setting, such as a bathroom or changing area, recording someone without their knowledge is illegal."" **UNLESS** the state has a 2 party consent law.  All they did that could be charged by the police is trespassing and even then they left without argument once the police did show up, which is why the cops didn't do anything about it.",il8d4bc
"Yeah, anyone who's worked more than two weeks in a retail store is really sick of people like this. I don't have time to be harassed and messed with for the camera, so yeah, I'm gonna tell people to stop filming.   People used to do this fairly regularly at my old job, that'd walk around with a camera making footage for their friends or their *super witty* YouTube video. I was over it pretty quickly and just took to telling them to buzz off.",il8xmg8
"A bit of clarification here for a common misconception. You are correct, there is nothing wrong (depending on the local laws) with recording in public places. However, retail locations and most other businesses are not public areas. It is private property that you are allowed to come purchase items from during certain times of the day. Actual public areas fall along the lines of sidewalks, streets, parks, etc. They are usually locations owned by the city/state and paid for by taxpayers (the general public). Business buildings, even their parking lots, are owned by landlords or the business themselves not the general public.  Either way, in almost all circumstances, you should always ask permission to film. It should be common courtesy out of shear decency, especially to people who are just trying to do their job.",il8mriq

Any help or link where I can take a look?",wqed2b

"Hi!  So the answer you're looking for is yes, as long as it follows the Best Buy ""Qualified Gift"" rules (available through HR) you should be fine. I don't know all the specifics however the main ones that I remember are:  * You have to be making a gift purchase to be given to an individual for individual use, or to a qualified non-profit organization * Cannot purchase items for use in for profit business, or to be intended for resale using employee discount  * Employee cannot be reimbursed by the person/organization you're giving the gift to * Additionally, it is my understanding that employees may purchase GSP/ Protection and services/ installations as qualified gifts as well.  If you purchase through dotcom make sure the shipping/ delivery address is for that person, not your address * I personally recommended that the services/ GSP be setup in the name of the person / organization you're giving the gift to * Also recommend that you put the gift purchase on it's own sale/purchase and don't combine with other personal purchases * Strongly recommend you provide the giftee with a gift receipt, if not a copy of the actual receipt for their records, and in case anything happens where they have to warranty claim on it. *  If you're shipping to a different store for pickup, make sure you list the person picking up the product's actual first and last name as it says on their state issued ID, and tell them to bring state issued ID with them to pickup.  Finally, be aware that employee purchases, including qualified gifts, are tracked and can be scrutinized by internal audit / asset protection teams and discounted goods/ services/ etc. may also count as taxable non-wage income on your W-2. If you have specific questions, don't take my word for it--follow up with a inquiry to HR about the qualified gift policy to make sure you're making the right choices and following the procedures correctly.   TLDR: Yes you can use employee discount for QUALIFIED GIFTS. There is a policy. Follow up with HR for specific details on what you can and can't do.  Good luck!",imcay2w
The official best buy response is that your employee discount cannot be used for purchasing items for other people,ikpbigg
"But it‚Äôs a gift so I thought there was an exception for gifting things to people, so long as you didn‚Äôt get reimbursed for it.",ikpougi
This may be inaccurate info; but understandable if you're not sure which policy to look for. Look up the qualified gift policy in HR web portal / ETK or see my reply above.,imcb593

She WILL eventually cut EVERY full time worker- management, sales, warehouse, distribution and everything else. The endgame appears to be reduce Best Buy to being an IP that will be sold to Amazon and Amazon will take over the actual operational costs while it gains a  retail showroom. So for any of you who thought that timeline was somewhere far off in the future, take a HARD look at a week ago, the second massive layoff in two years.  She is intentionally crippling the stores so that she can justify closing them when sales inevitably fall after lack of service drives customers completely out of brick and mortar. Her ""facts"" used to justify doing this are a set of self-fulfilling dictums which falsely inflate online sales figures while minimizing brick and mortar contributions, and she's either too greedy or too stupid to see that either she is being fed bad information or more likely, she is the source of that misinformation.  Right now, cutting staff can produce short term gains, but it is at the cost of long-term stability and sustainability and she knows that. When the stock value inevitably starts tanking hard and doesn't stop, the short term losses it causes will be assets, as she and the board can buy back even more shares of the company and when the sale to Amazon goes through, those shares will become worth billions. You aren't allowed to read about this on the ""other"" sub because the mods there are in bed with corporate and even though almost ALL of this information is public, discussion of it is actively suppressed, so for anyone who is thinking of making a career out of Best Buy, think twice.",wkca45

"Then work remotely. That side of the business is booming. It was expected that eventually sups and management in store would get cut. There's so many of them and far less advisors who are actually customer facing/assisting. The ratio was way off and they were getting paid more to essentially do less. Those cuts should have been made at the same time as last year in one big snap to balance out both ends. Why they decided to wait a whole nother year, proabably for stock and shareholder purposes.",ijnvpz2

If you can't swap over, help geek squad as much as you can with scheduling, if you have a GS supe, get in good with them, do GS elearnings after BSing/speedrunning your way through your PF and retail so you can technically claim to have experience working alongside geek squad.",ijr54mc

I was just saying its another side of the bussiness thats doing pretty good right now with the Totaltech support. And protection repairs. The other portion of what I was saying still stands.

Tuition?; I heard Best Buy pays for tuition is this true? I‚Äôve only been here 2 months so idk all the benefits but I‚Äôm currently taking summer college courses and if Best Buy would pay for that id like to find out how,vxega2
Just received it last semester. It‚Äôs for full time employees but there are requirements that need to be met even if you are full time. One being that you need to be with the company for at least 6 months to apply.,ifyzjrk
"Full time benefit, there should be details about benefits posted in the hub, or search ETK for the myHr page that should have info",ifvranm
There are some collage tuition discounts for part time employees as well. If you search tuition in BBY connect there‚Äôs a list. It tells you about the in person and online collages that offer discounts for you and sometimes even family members.,ifz5fil
"Is it possible to use my employee discount to buy something from the website ?; If so, how?",vv304y
Yes register your BBY.com account on the employee page of etk,ifim752
go to the best buy website go to account and you will see employee discount and you will put your employee number in and your all set now ou must go to cart to see the regular price and the employee price hope this helped .....,ikki5fw
"So I did that, but how I actually apply the discount?",ifsufxb

What are ways I can actually learn about different products and reading the specs to improve my sales. Don‚Äôt say E Learnings. Are there any youtubers or videos that inform on things like cameras and stuff. Thanks",vlfo5s
HDTVtest on YouTube is a very good tv review source. He is from Europe but he reviews the same TVs as the ones in the US.  The reason I like him so much is that he actually knows what he‚Äôs talking about and he‚Äôs honest.,idv4x5j

Digital Trends for Home Theater is a good YouTube channel,idx8bsh
One thing I‚Äôve found really helpful if someone is asking the difference between cameras there are a lot of websites that give direct comparisons between products so this helped me learn a lot. Also yeah I literally will just read specs to understand more. Google is also your best friend at work. Asking coworkers that know more is another way I‚Äôve learned a lot. Only been there 2 months tho so much more to learn. Mobile is weird,ih06rqt

He acknowledged that indeed applied to the Apple Professional Position, but that the description was misleading and he then revealed to me that that particular position isn‚Äôt real. It is really a general CA position.  I drove an hour and 40 minutes from my current job to get to the Best Buy location for an interview only to be told that the job I applied for doesn‚Äôt exist.  I am astounded.",vchd5h
"Yeah, I used to have that spot. It's a regular CA position, but you're expected to know/learn the ins and outs of Apple's repair program and the associated devices (iPhone, iPads, Watches, AirPods, etc).  As a perk, you get either an iPhone or an iPad loaner. It can be a bit of a process to get it seeing as they only open up the sign-ups once or twice a year, but it's yours to use as you see fit (until you turn it in at the end of the year so they can send you the newest model). It has AppleCare+ and you have to turn it back in unbroken or repaired.  I'm genuinely curious what the posting made the job sound like. Did it sound like it was dealing exclusively with Apple products? Did it seem like a sales position? I got the job internally (I was already a CA), so I didn't see a posting, they just made me the ""Apple Pro"".",iddumnk

"What are some things you'd like to see improve?; Basically the title. I think the biggest one right now is pay, which feels like the company is just whiffing on given the recent changes in the economy and the job market. The bump to the minimum a couple years ago was great, don't get me wrong, but for workers who have tenure it sort of feels like you're just not valuable.  The overall staffing levels seem to really be terrible company-wide too.

"I agree with most of the above comments., but one thing that bothers me is ""we're all about mental health, but your only allowed 5 days of sick time a year."" (Even if you have pto).  So I'm only supposed to  have physical/mental issues less than 2% of the year?",ibd99di

"Do you think the number of guaranteed hours should be fairer to employees, particularly part-time employees?

"I feel that, which seems to be the most common thing I hear about at work too. Do you think the company should do periodic cost of living adjustments when inflation exceeds a certain point (basically out of band from your annual)?",ibg8rnf

"Instant rebate issues - customer service hates me?; Sorry, couldn‚Äôt think of a better title. Anyway - I‚Äôm a customer, my grandparents are old and decided they wanted to buy us new appliances for our first house. We bought 4 LG appliances to get the 10% off instant rebate, but ended up having to do 2 separate transactions online because the fridge would show as out of stock unless it was the only thing being purchased. This messed up the instant 10% rebate.   I talked to a lot of people at customer service (online and on the phone) about it and finally someone understood. He talked to his supervisor and was able to get approval to issue me $900 in gift cards instead of a refund. Okay, cool, no biggie. He said it would be split into 2 because of the high dollar amount.  Again, cool.  After 2 hours on the phone, he assured me we were good to go and gave me a reference number ‚Äújust in case.‚Äù   I called in today to ask if they could give me the gift card number over the phone so I could make on online purchase before the physical cards arrive. After being transferred 4 times, I finally am talking to someone who says he can help.

The rep I‚Äôm talking to eventually tells me that that those gift cards weren‚Äôt actually issued and I wouldn‚Äôt be getting them. He said it was because one gift card had already been issued to me and they can only do one gift card per order. The gift card I had received was for like $150 because I had a hell of a time getting the contractors to come out and install the waterline for my fridge. The conversation ended with me talking to his supervisor who told me he could offer a gift card for $200 but that was it. He said he was the highest level of supervisor to talk to, he agreed I was entitled to the full $900 but said he could only do $200 and that I shouldn‚Äôt have trusted the previous reps that I had talked to??

It's 15 starting and you cap out at 17. A lot of people don't realize that when they raised the minimum they decreased the wage gap from new hires to tenured people by a lot. A multi billion dollar company that acts like they can barely keep thr lights on and likes to keep us at a barely livable wage.. üòë,i9h3kye
It‚Äôs $15 everywhere,i5wlx7q
15 starting,i6fbel8
Don‚Äôt know,i7tqfop
Minimum is $15 but in some markets they start higher,i5xsro3
"If I use someone else's account phone number but I swipe my BBY credit card, who ends up with the points?; I am an Elite Plus member and a BBY Visa cardholder. FML. My friend has total tech. My Elite Plus benefits are getting stripped away from me, mainly 45 day returns. If I give my friend's phone number (total tech, 60 day returns), and swipe MY (non total tech) credit card, which account ends up with the points? No speculation please, only actual answers. Thanks.",u9gjw5
Your friends phone number will carry the my bby return info,i5vf49f
lol it‚Äôs just gonna be credit card holders that get rewards soon,i712ecz
"Yes thanks, that's the whole point of using their number, to take advantage of the 60 day returns associated with their total tech account. Just wanted to know if the My Best Buy rewards points would be added to the phone number account, or the account linked to the Best Buy Visa card.",i5vtx2d
ITS EARTH DAY LOOK HOW MUCH STUFF WE RECYCLE; but we won't let employees take recycling because we'd rather send GOOOD PRODUCTS to be destroyed  rather than reused ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,u9gfjv
"Purchased PTO & Shift Bid; New Hire here. I heard you can you can purchased additional PTO time if you‚Äôre full time. Is that true and when can it be done? Also, has anyone done shift bid? Thanks!",u3qebi
"Not sure the answers to you question but the idea of purchasing PTO is ludicrous. If the net operation ends up as zero, why just not allow employees unpaid time off? PTO is not a fungible asset and shouldn't be used as such.",i4s512w
Purchasing pro is during open enrollment and it‚Äôs a max of 40hrs a year I do every year! Its not really purchasing pto u have to think of it as setting your pay aside for when u decide to take a week off and still get paid. The cost of your pto days is based on your yearly salary. So however much you get paid per week is how much your 40 hours of pto will cost you. The benefit is that you can use them the first week in January if u want to even though they haven‚Äôt been paid for yet because they take it out a little each pay check. Hope this makes sense,i95tw0q
"Purchasing pto is only during open enrollment in October. Or during your new employee enrollment period. I don‚Äôt remember if that‚Äôs 30 days or 60 days from your hire date.  We don‚Äôt do shift bids, we have a billboard where open shifts can be claimed but you can favorite your departments but it honestly doesn‚Äôt do anything systematically.",i8itw0e
"Agreed. From my understanding, you have a certain amount per year and then can purchase more if you use or plan to use that amount per year. Every other retailer I‚Äôve worked at let‚Äôs you get unpaid.",i4s6nhp
You an take unpaid.  Purchasing pto I would only recommend for those who do not get sick pay from their state and want to use their normal PTO for vacations. As a buffer. But yes. You‚Äôd be letting the company borrow your money interest free to pay yourself back later.,i8itouy
Thank you so much!,i95tz7n
I've had a varied experience with different managers. The purchasing of PTO is just extra unnecessary steps so it feels like something sneaky is afoot. One year I miscalculated 1 hour of PTO to use it up before reset since it doesn't roll over and went negative. BBY FORCED an 8 hr (full day) PTO purchase on my paycheck.,i4s8y4q
Not necessarily oftentimes pto is paid to the employee before they have even worked enough to have paid for it.,i95uo3n
Will Best Buy price match anywhere super cheap?,u2sqlk
"No, they have a list of places they will price match with. supermarketsus is not one of them",i4ksvpk
Lmao no,i4l0zdy
Hahahaha nah,i4m625h
Supermarket-sus‚Ä¶..,i4mflps
That's some wish.com type shit,i4ougun
Absolutely not,i5ngirw
This Oculus runs off size D batteries üòÇ,ibbhomi
This place looks like they bout to steal your identity and your money ü§£,ihrqkcq
priorities; It's honestly sad how managers are prioritizing pushing out the BB card and TT membership than customer experience. I'm the type of person to care more about what the customer wants and get them exactly that than trying to shove a card down their throat all the time. All I hear over the walkie every 5 min is c'mon guys who's getting the next card or TT like whatt? They don't care if the customer is buying a bag of chips they want a card out of it smh. How do u guys feel about this? Is it similar at your stores?,u2fy38
"Guys how you think BestBuy makes money, it‚Äôs sad to say that we need to make a paycheck and pay the stores bills, we complain about a job but with out that we will lose our job.",i4wx1c8
I legitimately feel like they should just make sales commission on apps/TT and get it over with (like $5 for every Best Buy credit card and $10 for every TT). Then they wouldn‚Äôt need to beg for apps/TTs all day over the radio because salespeople would have a financial incentive to get them.   I DO hate hearing that shit on the radio though. I‚Äôll turn it off and forget I did it until I need an override or something. The radios shouldn‚Äôt be used for that crap.,i4ki82o
"It is kinda hard to bring up TT when someone is buying just a phone case. People want instant results from their money, so they'll buy TT when it pays for itself or is a good investment for very soon. Same for BP's",i4mmscq
"You will find this is the norm for most Best Buy's, the customer experience (Which was the draw to Best Buy in the first place.) is gone. Now managers only look at metrics like the ones you described but ask any customer and few of them will care.",i5ne3zn
"stay true to your own morals. If management yells at you just say you don't feel comfortable because it doesn't make sense, when they say ""don't sell out of your pocket"" ask them if they'd buy a plan or get a credit card when buying a phone case.   if they say why aren't you asking more questions to make an argument for the card or plan, say you're trying to give the client a genuine frictionless interaction, and when it makes sense to bring up one of those options.",i5r7yhz
Yea pretty much the same. At this point I just started not asking customers about it anymore.,it92non
Any advice or comments about me wanting to apply; Hi! I‚Äôm 20 and I want to apply for the basic associate position. I‚Äôm going home for the summer and just need a job to hold me over. I know it pays $15/hr. I also know you have to talk to customers and try try to give them credit cards. But from what I‚Äôve heard there is also a good share of ‚Äúdown‚Äù time when the story isn‚Äôt busy or in the spring/summer. Is this all true stuff?   I worked at Home Depot for a year. I don‚Äôt mind talking to customers as long as I‚Äôm not yelled at every 5 seconds. I also know a good bit about technology (apple products lab tops headphones tvs) as I watch a lot of YouTube and own a lot of tech. The one thing I do need is a consistent schedule‚Ä¶ looking for like 30-35 hours max with with the same days or hours every week. This is because I‚Äôm gonna be in physical therapy.   I‚Äôll also mention the store is in a suburb of Cleveland Ohio so it‚Äôs not like mega busy or anything. Does anyone have any tips for getting hired? Any grievances or comments u want to express before I apply? I‚Äôd appreciate anything as I really don‚Äôt wanna work a sucky job for 3 months lol,u05hnv
"right now at my store full timers are getting close to 25 hours due to excess ‚Äúdown time‚Äù. The company is great for retail, but don‚Äôt expect them to give you the necessary $",i44anuj
"Unless you are hired full time (no less than 30 weekly hrs, no more than 40(typically)) and are transparent with whoever schedules you about your availability, it's really rare to get a consistent schedule, especially in a position that is so fluid with shifts/callouts.   Considering location/season you should have a good amount of downtime which leaves room for managers to badger you about low numbers, but its definitely manageable, and being that it's just for the summer, you should be alright. Remember to use that discount once active!!!!!",i46cmt9
"It‚Äôs definitely a good job especially with the discounts. But definitely wouldn‚Äôt expect to have 30-35 hours a week consistently. I‚Äôm a territory rep down in Florida and we have a mix of super busy stores and super slow stores. The one thing I‚Äôve heard all around is that Best Buy is not giving hours but are still expecting the same goals pre-Covid. Best case scenario, they have the hours to give you and you have a good time. Worst case scenario, you may only work one day a week",i45q0he
Don‚Äôt do it,i607xes
What do you mean by necessary money? I thought everything started at $15 company wide? Which is pretty good for my area tbh cause apparently our ‚Äúliveable wage‚Äù is only 12,i454y6j
i‚Äôm almost at $17 and bc my short hours i can barely make ends meet. i know a few other full time employees in the same boat  just make sure to ask about the hours they are willing to give before jumping in. it‚Äôs hard to have 2 jobs when you technically need open availability,i46reyf
I‚Äôm never getting promoted; When you put your all into a company and you are over look. Because of the fear of losing top talent. You can‚Äôt be great in your role or go above and beyond because your boss is dependent of you to succeed and look good to his own boss and keep his or hers mental health. Development is a joke. It‚Äôs all manipulative‚Ä¶.. that‚Äôs just my opinion.,tzf806
"I agree, I, along with many many people on here, who have been top performers have to find out what path you want. I had a discussion about this with my sup and he said to dial it back to like 60-70% performance just enough to keep you afloat and use the remaining bit on building your brand and helping coach others etc and now I‚Äôm a GSM from sales advisor. I‚Äôve been with Best Buy for over 3 years. It‚Äôs important to talk to your management about a developmental path and be serious about it. Hope that kind of helps. Cheers!",i3yoo1y
This is something way above those job codes my friend ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ only those who are in those roles will understand.,i3yp9c0
This is Best Buy culture my friend. Your best bet is to get the fuck out before it screws up your own mental health.,i5s2dny
"got an email that said ‚ÄúBest Buy does NOT guarantee a specific number of work hours to any employee‚Äù and now i‚Äôm fuming.; you expect me to show up at a certain time, dress a certain way, work a certain pace, and to meet all expectations with a fucking smile while knowing that you wont guarantee that my hard work will help me pay my fucking rent?? likes it‚Äôs a privilege that I get to be here?",tvae2o
they told me that its guaranteed,i3giovv
Then find a new job?,i4yxtmq
Only full timers are guaranteed 32. Part timers are not guaranteed anything.,i8iu42b
Full timers at my store are getting 28 hrs now. Really obvious best buy doesn‚Äôt care about its employees.,ii8dyd3
Most retailers do not guarantee hours. Target doesn't hire most employees full time. Walmart is all over the place. Amazon well you can go from 35/40 hours to 70 mandatory hours.,i38b3vi
I thought you needed 32 hours to at least get benefits,i9pen4a
Wow,i9piy6y
but they lied,i3gip9l
Just put my two weeks in. New job guaranteed 40 hours at $7 more an hour.,i8kvz3p
i am a full timer.,i8jewah
yeah that‚Äôs what i thought too. Kept my benefits even tho I averaged 25-28 hours a week for like a year.,i9pibqw
What email did you get then?  Should reword that. Who did you get the email from? Or was it an auto corporate email?,i8jf6zk
"from HR, not an official company wide email",i8kb6mw
Did you go asking or was this new hire paperwork? I don‚Äôt remember where it is written down but full timers must be scheduled 32hours. If I have a chance to go looking today I can tell you. It may be because the law defines full timers as 32+ but not 100% sure. I just know it‚Äôs been a rule for decades,i8lb92h
it was unprompted. A ton of people weren‚Äôt even getting 32 hours. Some were only getting 25 (i was scheduled 32 but i‚Äôm small parcel and only had 20 hrs worth of work and no help needed in the warehouse). HR sent it out randomly probably due to complaints. In utah,i8lbg18
corporate just slap the s*** out me!,trfy8g
"IF YOUR RAISE IS NOT COMPARABLE TO INFLATION, YOU ARE RECEIVING A PAY CUT üëè",i2paxej

"My Best Buy changes; TL;dr: All tiers going away, everyone gets 1% back, only Best Buy credit card holders get point banking and 5%, and unless return policy is changed everyone is 15 days except TotalTech members who will be 60 days. Text of email below.  ‚Äî‚Äî  Dear My Best Buy¬Æ member,   Thank you for being a part of My Best Buy. We would like to inform you of the updated Terms and Conditions, including changes to the dispute resolution terms, coming to the My Best Buy program on May 3, 2022 ([View updated My Best Buy program Terms here](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/my-best-buy/my-best-buy-program-rules/pcmcat311100050001.c?id=pcmcat311100050001)).   In an effort to simplify the program, we will be consolidating the Elite Plus, Elite and My Best Buy tiers into a single tier. On May 3, 2022, My Best Buy members in the Elite and Elite Plus tier will be moved into the standard My Best Buy program*.   We are also updating how points are displayed within the program.

"I swear, moves like this is what will turn our company into circuit city.",i2l2nex
The company is losing my $15K appliance purchase over this.  Check the other subreddit and you'll see a lot of pissed off customers many of which are returning items or buying elsewhere from now on.  When someone gets points and becomes an upper tier member like myself we expect certain things and one of them is not for the program we just qualified for a month or two back to go away with 6 weeks notice.  Who does that?  Oh wait. That's right it's the new CEO who's taking something that's working and killing it. Did they learn nothing from JC Penney and similar companies that pulled this stunt and now struggle to survive?    Most won't read the email and will be shocked when they find out and they'll complain by no longer doing business with BB.    There's to many options out there for a company to pull a stunt like this.     Let's not mention the email being vague and not informing their customers of all the details of all the things that they are losing.   I don't get these companies.   Oh well. I'm going back to buying local. I didn't save that much going to BB. I did it for the points and such.   The local place will love to see me walk back in.   Good luck folks,i2npkv3
"As someone who spends over 3,500 at Best Buy every year this is a slap to the face. I‚Äôm canceling my 20 pre orders for 4k blu rays as we speak and ordering from elsewhere.

Current Elite Plus and for the moment Total Tech member - I find this move to be an ethical breach of contract.  The deal was we spent a certain level last year and get benefits this year.  Now Best Buy is reneging on the deal mid year.  At the very least this should have been an end of year move.  I‚Äôm sure they have lots of safe harbor ‚Äúwe have all the rights you have none‚Äù fine print items to prevent an actual breach of contract legal action but ethically speaking I think that‚Äôs what they‚Äôve done here.  It really makes me question if I want to do any further business with them.,i3s6gm3
Over here with 15k in purchases this year. They lost a customer and will rather purchase my things somewhere else smh,i5wv9ta
"I really make a point to not purchase on Amazon as they are getting too big - so that means Best Buy when I can. Elite Plus member here - but barely. I rerouted a purchase to Best Buy in December to get me over the line for the next year.  I also managed to get a nice video card from Best Buy at MSRP last year because they did a nice job with the anti-bot tech - and didn't give in to raising prices beyond MSRP like for example newegg. I wrote a glowing review of the product and best buy because it felt like they were really batting for me ""Joe Consumer"" and being ethical about pricing. Next round of video cards were only made available to those who paid for Best Buy's Total Tech. Don't need that personally.  I'm in IT, I get the simplification piece of doing away with all the tiers - but that was sunk cost for the most part it seems. ""Simplification"" seems like a mostly made-up reason.   As other have said, this was a program that was clearly working to do what a rewards program should - routing dollars to the business instead of another business. To what level it is hard to say - maybe not enough. Feels like they are going the wrong way with this - and maybe Total Tech should have been included in Elite Plus as a perk.  All that said, I'm still routing my $ to BestBuy when possible to help them survive. They are the only real electronics store near me left. From there, my only options are Walmart and Target or maybe Kohls for small appliances - and they have a much more limited - and lower tier list of items for sale in store.",i6gbd5z
I just noticed this today when I wasn't getting free shipping.  Taking my business elsewhere...elite plus was the main reason I shopped at BB.  No free shipping and no extended return policy...Slap in the face for long time members...,i9qtphw

"I just noticed this today, have yet to receive any email letting me know that they will be loosing a long time elite plus member: I. The last 4 months I have spent over $13,000 on some new photography equipment. With this change and the lack of being able to find anything in my local stores I‚Äôm done!  I give them a year or so and we will see them continuing to fade away. Looks like many of use will be taking our hard earned cash elsewhere. See what they do when they start loosing the high dollar accounts. I really wish some of my local camera stores had more stock but maybe it‚Äôs time to get back to the store and show them That customer service will bring us back and continue to spend thousands a year locally.   I can‚Äôt remedy the last time I‚Äôve been able to actually find something in store and not have to order it. Even then I‚Äôve had 3 high dollar orders over $3000 cancel on me after placing the order.   This doesn‚Äôt surprise me unfortunately. Looks like it time to use my 29,000 points before I break ties.",i8tqeil
Soooo...I guess I'm kinda done with Best Buy now. This really is a slap in the face to their loyal customers. There's not enough benefit in the Total Tech package to warrant me paying $200.   I guess it's Amazon and Microcenter from here on out.,i9z1y2n

We already had a Best Buy near us close down.  The writing is on the wall for Best Buy when they make stupid decisions like this.  No more best buy for me.  Good riddens.

literally found this out this past week. I didnt get an email about it - must have deleted it without reading...     I had just purchased about $1300 of electronics last week. I then proceeded to return $1300 worth of electronics and bought it all on Amazon and eBay for better pricing anyways. The tier program and being Elite Plus was the only thing keeping me at Best Buy. Before that it was the gaming pass. very upset about the whole thing,iajhsdq

RIP best buy I was about to go buy a ps5 after I just bought 2 computers worth of components I figured after the $3000 I spent I would have some points stacked up and be an elite member since there was a $1500 threshold before . I go to check my account and nope I have 10 points and found out about this new system that‚Äôs really fucking stupid I will just got elsewhere now.,jaczz6f
That can't come soon enough. I have been an elite plus member (or its past equivalent) for over 15 years...back when you paid for the membership. They should've announced the changes effective the end of the year. The points is one thing but taking away the free shipping after people have made a point of attaining the mid/high tier for that benefit is lower than anything CC did.  I won't say that I'm not going to enter a Best Buy again. That would be a lie. However I will not spend another cent there. By making this change Best Buy has told their most loyal customers that they don't value loyalty. Thank you for becoming nothing more than a showroom for Amazon and other online retailers.,i91988o
What other subreddit?,incvp72
"I just ordered something yesterday (EP and CC member) was free shipping, but it was $500 so maybe they upped the threshold?  Quick check $22 4k BD was shipping, $49 Switch game was free.",i9w7b5f
Right there with you‚Ä¶. There is strength in numbers -  if all of us elite plus boycott them they will fill the pain!!!!  $3500+ a year in Amazons pocket multiplied by thousands will surely be their consequence!!!!,iajc3ke
and free delivery in general I thought. Only total tech gets it now? or is it still free shipping?,iajhxk7
Literally the only reason I used Best Buy.,ignionf
"Same realization here, frantic googling to see why I'm only showing 1% rewards on a $3000 item I bought led me here. Packing it back up and returning. Will buy elsewhere. I miss game pass...",iaqr2oo
Remember when we used to get points for Apple products? Pepridge farm remembers,incwjyw
They should honor it if it‚Äôs on the receipt you‚Äôre returning something on.,indxi0j
What do you go inside Best Buy for anymore? Our local stores are down to like 30% their former showroom space to make room for online orders and inventory in the back. There's hardly anything to browse anymore.,ilde5wt
Thanks. Fingers crossed   I became a elite member in 2021. It still shows free shipping. Perhaps because I got it in 2021 it has somehow made me immune until 2023?,indy3nj
"Mostly to grab something at the last minute when I couldn't wait what has been an ever slowing Prime delivery. I've completely stopped using Best Buy shipping just based on principle (being charged after having earned free shipping). I now only use it for the same thing that eventually killed CC...a showroom to look at something before jumping on the Amazon app (usually while still in the store). Even the BF deals on media get matched or are ""lightning deals"" on Amazon. I feel for the employees who work at a place whose leadership keeps letting them down. The curbside runners always seemed to be in a good mood despite what they were doing.",ildjjgb
I want to say I recalled reading something internally about a few customers getting to keep it as a test. It‚Äôs possible you‚Äôre one of those folks.,inj93pb

"TV came broken, didn't open for 4 months due to basement remodel, out of exchange period now. What can I do?; Bought an 82"" Samsung TV for my basement remodel during Black Friday. Remodel ran long so the TV sat safely in its box upstairs in an office. When the remodel finally finished early this month, I brought the TV down and unboxed it and turned it on just to find that the display was either defective or cracked. It looks like it took a bit of a hit before being boxed.      I have heard that this is not all that uncommon and that BestBuy or Samsung with generally take them back, but only during the 30 day exchange period. Since I was unaware of the fault (as I waited for the basement to be ready for the TV), I am quite a bit out of that 30 day period.      TV was purchased from BestBuy, but they are saying they can do nothing to help me. It has been more than 30 days, and they say anything after that falls under Samsung's window.      Samsung says that it is ""clearly accidental damage"" when I show them photos. I guess I understand where they may be coming from, but the TV has safely been in a box for the last few months. There was no damage to the box. They just say that I am lying.      It was purchased on Amex, but they seem to only give me extended protection for 60 days. Out of luck there too.      Am I just completely screwed out of thousands of dollars now because I was sold a broken TV? I don't feel like I should have fault just for leaving it aside for a bit. Do I have any additional options for recourse?",tqcpc5
"It‚Äôs under warranty. If Samsung is refusing, and if it costs as much as you‚Äôre saying, the next step is a lawyer. Usually a demand letter from a law office is enough to get someone‚Äôs attention alone, but failing that, you‚Äôll at least know what your options are from speaking with the lawyer.   At a store level anything past sixty days is pretty much untouchable.",i2gkk1d

"No. OP has the burden of proof that it was broken when purchased, which is impossible. There's no way to prove OP didn't break it while unboxing it. Which is why Best Buy always recommends having it delivered and installed. Or you can have the TV checked before leaving the building. Or open it within the warranty.  Sorry OP. Though you may feel like you're being screwed, the burden of proof is on you. Prove it was broken from the factory and you'll get a replacement.",i3231za

Starting pay is a bii I t higher than normal starting pay because of it being a vpl position and pay can very by location. A typical day is standing greeting customers and trying to sell not just the product but also a credit application and a total tech. It‚Äôs easy for a good ‚Äúsalesperson ‚Äú it‚Äôs hard and unrewarding for everyone else. I personally like the job but I‚Äôm a salesperson at heart and see things like credit cards and tts as goals not burdens.,hyjrjsa

"Rant Time!; Rant time!  I work in mobile and my store gets so busy throughout the day, most days, and we are so understaffed due to corporate not only extending our operating hours, but also taking away around 8 hours of labor from our department, that I am working back to back with customers that have been waiting in the queue for 20+ minutes.   What this leads to is most mobile associates not being able to take our California government required 10min rest breaks.   I‚Äôm not sure about other states, but in California we are apparently supposed to get paid an extra hour of labor at our regular rate for each break we are not given and even though nobody at Best Buy explicitly says ‚Äúno you can‚Äôt take a break‚Äù, it is  heavily implied that we shouldn‚Äôt (especially when we are super busy).   Best Buy reports record profits but keeps cutting labor which puts the pressure even more on us because we have to keep picking up the slack for missing coworkers, which is also leading to an ever decreasing moral and mental health of employees, leading to more call outs and even more missing labor.   Best Buy corporate needs to either start hiring more people or implement break tracking with TLC to make sure employees are getting properly compensated for missing breaks. While employees own a certain amount of responsibility to make sure they take their breaks, the company owns even more of that responsibility as they don‚Äôt schedule enough people in specialized departments like mobile, who can cover for breaks.   So assuming you‚Äôve been working full time for Best Buy for a few years and how many breaks you have been forced to skip due to low coverage. 40 breaks? 100 breaks? So many you don‚Äôt even know what a break is anymore?  If the company minimum wage is $15/hr, how much money has Best Buy stolen from you? One hundred breaks at minimum wage is $1500, granted a decent chunk of that is taxed and I don‚Äôt know about you, but shoot I sure could use the rest for bills.    Just remember though! ‚ÄúBE HUMAN‚Äù",sygsv3

"How to prepare as a customer experience specialist?; Am I going to be pressured to up sell credit cards and services like people say? I mean currently I do that but with grocery food like enticing people with buy one get one offers, which is nothing like asking someone to open a line of credit. But I can learn.",sv7wub
"Yes, but as long as you‚Äôre making genuine offers that should be where the pressure ends. This is also where top down selling helps with credit cards anyways because if someone pushes back on price it‚Äôs an organic point to bring up deferred interest financing. For services it‚Äôll require a combination of listening and probing questions (if someone asks about getting a TV mounted that‚Äôs a good spot to open up about how you can help, if you‚Äôre selling a computer ask if they‚Äôll need help getting it set up and stuff moved to their new one from their old one, etc).   During training you‚Äôll get a number of examples like this that are department specific, and with some practice it should become natural for you to work it in to your interactions.",hxg65qq
Just do your job and don‚Äôt worry about the rest. As long as you are doing your part they shouldn‚Äôt harass you about cards and what not.

"Need Advice made a mistake!; Hello I just started working here a little over a month ago. Earlier today I did a price match on a Mr. Coffee frappe machine. A customer wanted me to price match the one from Walmart. The one we sold was 109.99 while the one on Walmarts website was 99.00. I double checked by typing in the model number into Google to see if it would bring it up, and it did. I thought I read the numbers right and went ahead and price matched it.   The make, the color, that was the same.   Just found out the model number was NOT the same as I initially thought.   The model I sold her was 2149282.   The model I price matched was 2142925.   It was a major oversight on my part because I thought they were the same when I also looked it up in Walmarts online app. And I did it again but now it's saying it can't be found! I heard a horror story how Best BUY priced matched some premium appliances and as a result the company couldn't sell the appliances for years!   And a manager did approve of this he took me for my word! And now I feel like shit! Is he going to get in trouble because of me?! What should I do?

Any Small Parcel Drivers on here?; I‚Äôve been a SP driver for a year now and have been told the ENTIRE YEAR that they are expecting the workload to pickup and as a result Ill be able to get my hours in.   I‚Äôve been a full time employee for 8 months. For the first 4 of those months I‚Äôve averaged 11 hours due to package load. Whenever I expressed a concern about my hours I was always told ‚Äúit will pick up‚Äù or ‚Äúyou can ask the warehouse of your store for work and get your hours there‚Äù. Whenever I go to the warehouse for hours they tell me they don‚Äôt need me. Besides I don‚Äôt have the same access to programs as they do so I am unable to help out doing the work needing to be done without having a warehouse employee babysitting my computer.   Same days started up and I started getting more work. I‚Äôm grateful for it BUT I am still only scheduled 32 hours. On average I only work 28 of those hours.   I want there to be a daily rate or guaranteed 40 hours. I‚Äôm tired of working 2 jobs to make ends meet because my full time job won‚Äôt compensate me. I am wondering if there are other small parcel drivers who have had a similar experience.,r4f01w
Have been since March when they expanded it and told a shit ton of employees to go fuck themselves. For awhile I was getting 35 hours thats mostly because we where splitting a day with a part time employee. That's recently changed and I should be closed to about 37 to 38 a week. I could easily be doing about 45 to 50 hours a week if I didn't have a second job I like and I could see shit after 5pm. We also have a seasonal working evenings so I can't stay out past 4 since they need the stuff when they come in.,hmgbsck

Ask them to cut the part time person down to 2. All stores in my area the part timer is at 2 days. Mine is at 2 and an afternoon. I'd your full time and arely getting 32 hours keep an eye on your average. If it goes below that for to long you can loose benefits.,hmgd1jn

Not many Canadian employees here but my general recommendation when it comes to new vs open box/refurbished is to buy new.

Tell your coworkers and get the ball rolling!,hkvvdc4
Right so heres the thing with best buy they do not care if you walk out because they will simply fire you and attempting to unionize they would do the same thing and replace you because its going to save them money and time in the end. They do not care about you they care about profits and how fast you can move. look at the new stores they introduced doing over 10000 picks a day including the store i work for is becoming one of these,hmukksb

"Best Buy Doesn't Care About Employees; Do you have no friends? No family? No outside interests? Then Best Buy is the job for you, because you'll never have time for those things, and they don't care! They own you, and they'll make sure you know it.   Want time off? Good luck! Especially around the holidays. They lose so many employees and are constantly understaffed because of the horrible way they treat people. But guess what? Because you stick around its your job to make up for their inadequacy! So don't you dare ask for time off. But watch the GM's come and go as they please, working ""half days"" or pretending they showed up at 6am to leave at 2pm on a Saturday, or scheduling full weeks ""working from home"".   Customers get to treat you like shit. They yell and cuss at you and Best Buy will just allow it. Better thicken up that skin before your shift.   Want a regular schedule so you can plan your life? HA! Your schedule will NEVER be the same week to week (except to know you work at least 6 days a week). If you are lucky enough to get 2 days off, they're split. And your shifts will look something like; 10am-8pm, 11am- 10pm. I'd love someone to genuinely explain how you have a life with those kinds of shifts 6 days a week. You will never have a weekend day off ever again.   Bottom line, Best Buy exhibits behavior that their employees are expendable and replaceable. Its clear they no longer see a value in people at all. Probably because they realized during 2020 they could make more money moving their platform online.

"Pre $15/hr increase workers denied 3 percent raise. New employees at 1 year receive.; I've been with bestbuy since 2019. It was a soft place to land when I left my long term degree field career to follow my dream of being a highschool history teacher.  The promise of fair wages,  annual increases,  tuition reimbursement,  and flexible hours was a dream.  Though I had to scrimp and scrape to make that dream work.  I started at $10/hr part time,  and with hard work and great numbers for a noob was given the first available full time spot and moved to $10.50 roughly four months later, and eventually $10.95 at my one year with ""Rockstar"" across the board. I respected my managers and still do, they're great and genuine leaders. I think of my best buy Co workers as some of my closest friends and even family, while also brining friends on with the promise of a fair place to work as long as you're willing to do your job and learn new things while helping others ""discover what's possible"". When covid hit, there was no question in my mind that bestbuy was taking care of me, So, I would risk it and stay on curbside with only 7 other employees, and a couple managers in my store, deciding to not furlough. I had class, dealt with covid and was the best employee I could be for one of the best companies I had worked for. Finally, after covid we were all given increases to $15/hr starting wage. When people were staring to be let go because of the wage increase, I started looking for opportunities elsewhere. I quickly found a better paying job, plus commission at a spectrum retail location closer to home. Because I respect and care what my GM and ASM think, I went to them and asked them if I were in a position where it may come to down to having to choose between me and another employee to let me know, because I had another opportunity, though I didn't want to leave what I considered a home away from home. I was assured my job was never in question and a few days later was told I would be getting an increase of .50 cents that corporate had authorized GMs to give to employees that had deserved more than the $15/hr bump. Which, I really appreciated the recognition from my GM. My 3 year mark just hit in September and I was expecting the",qso748
"appreciated the recognition from my GM. My 3 year mark just hit in September and I was expecting the 3 percent increase that the people hired in at $15/hr received when we first opened back after the shut down. Two cheques passed and nothing. So, I called HR. Where they started treating me like I was stupid, the lady tried to tell me my .50 cent increase that I've had for almost a year was my 3 percent. I ""kindly"" gave her a math lesson, that 3 percent of 15 is .47 and that I should have that on top of the .50 cents my GM gave me with the general increase. After telling the lady she could stop lying and should just tell me if I was getting the increase or not, she finally said because I went from $10.95/hr to $15/hr they were considering that my yearly increase and would not be seeing the three percent promised to every employee by Corey in our email about the $15 minimum. Well, turns out that if you started at $15, you do get the 3 percent. Allowing employees that have only been with the company for a year to make more than those that had been here for years. Me being lucky am .03 cents ahead of the noobs in my store, but there are others that started around the same time I did, still only making $15 at their three year. While mediocre, and even under performing 1 year associates, unwilling to lift anything heavier than a toaster or try to sell enablers are making more. I made million dollar club the same month I hit three years. looking at that and then 700 plus branded payments and 600 plus TTS, I've peddaled to my clients, I feel like I've been slapped in the face by a company that I had decided to stick with, because I felt I was appreciated and valued. Seeing that they value every year I've spent here as .01 cent higher per year than what they value someone who's been here for a year, or gone from part time to full-time.   I guess my question is, are there any other long time employees that feel completely betrayed by the company? Not only betrayed, but lied to in being told and made to feel like you matter, only to find out that you don't?   I'm really questioning whether I should stay with the company.

"Well, I worked there for 4 years. 3 of being in the highest ranked sales position in the company (MDC/System Designer) my reasons were pretty well the same grievances company wide. My reasons were compounded by favoritism and sexual harassment. Note** MDC was 100% commission based. You could make ALOT of money if you‚Äôre a closer (I am, was one of the top network designers in the country)  Best Buy recently made the largest restructuring they‚Äôve had in over a decade. This roll out was through the pandemic and VERY ROUGH.   They went from hourly, specialized departments to hourly+commission store wide sales consultants. Meaning the sales people had to step out of their ‚Äúcomfort zone‚Äù and learn other parts of the store they were not familiar with. This new business model included in-home ‚ÄúSr. Sales Consultants‚Äù that would advise customers in their homes. On paper and in theory this is a smart move. A personal touch higher paid sales people that are more knowledgeable.   The problem with that is there are only a few guys skilled enough to do these roles and worked mainly on the MDC department along with a handful of Best Buy ‚ÄúIn home advisors‚Äù which were just more entry-level system designers. When they rolled everything out they stripped the majority system designers of their titles, made them focus on lesser products and learn the entire store. And high end or high level jobs would go to the 1 or 2 designers that would then take on everyone‚Äôs workload.   It was stressful as hell It was demoralizing being stripped of a prestigious title. It made us feel like a number in a machine  I personally was offered a pay cut and they tried to make me feel excited about it. (Most got raises, more on that later.) THEN MADE ME WORK MORE! The rest of the store basically got pay raises and demoted. It‚Äôs what it felt like. Payed more to eat more shit.  They stopped caring about the things that made the work place fun and focused heavily on subscription based services (TTS) and coached primarily on that. And getting credit cards. The important managers (GM/SSM) are rarely in the store to address concerns and the company has them hide behind a computer all day doing other things.  They are turning more stores into just warehouses, the staff is trained to hand the customer off to a sales consultant or sr sales consultant. So it makes the worker feel less important. A lot of people are taking pay cuts",hudxu80
"sales consultant. So it makes the worker feel less important. A lot of people are taking pay cuts to leave. In my store alone I can name 6 off the top of my head and more looking for other work. ALL of which where the best employees in the store.   My store went from 7 to 2 designers. One of which was a ‚Äústraight‚Äù man who asked me to have sex with his wife while he watched. Turns out he‚Äôs also both gay and straight. He‚Äôs had multiple sexual harassment accusations. Our store had a new GM take our store over and right before the switch. This GM had known the gay cuck for ‚Äúyears‚Äù Turns out he‚Äôs doing the interviews. Again, I was one of the top networking designers in the country, but he sold more TVs and sound-bars than me. I made the company more money, he sold more entry level product.   They promoted the gay cuck  Try to get me to hand my clients over to him.  My clients were CEOs, Lawyers, Real-estate investors. They were loyal to me. Repeat clients   His customer was a kid who‚Äôs parents own a small phone repair store that bought brackets and entry level TVs from him.

New hire that still needs to receive paperwork.; I was offered a position at by local Best Buy last Friday right after my second interview. The manager said I needed to fill out some e-forms but I have not yet received them. Do I wait until HR sends me them or should I contact the manager about them?,qgxqdr
I would reach out. If they gave you a direct line to contact them I‚Äôd do that or head into the store and speak to them directly (the store phone # redirects to the national line unless they provided you an extension to reach someone).   I would frame it as wanting to make sure you didn‚Äôt miss the email and making sure you got it filled out and submitted ASAP for them.,hi9zmna
"So, listen to my story. I was a new hire a few weeks ago. Went in for my first full time day, corporate hadn't sent my ""A number"" over. So I drove 45 minutes back home, this was on a Sunday. Didn't have me come in on Monday. Had me show up for four hours on Tuesday, then didn't schedule me any hours for the rest of the week. In the meantime I found a new job with actual hours and let the district manager know that I found new work due to the lack of hours I was being scheduled. Now I get messages at least twice a week asking if I want to work part time, asking if I'd like a seasonal position and then offering $2+ an hour. Runaway and find something more worth your time.

"New hire during holidays. Missed a monthly meeting.; Alas above. I was told that during holidays the new hires get culled. For instance it's almost Halloween. I've been super nervous about this job, particularly with my direct reporting manager. I'll explain, the only times I've ever showed up late( which was two times in a pretty short span, about 10isj min late) was when she was on shift. Just my luck. Well today apparently there was a mandatory meeting for everybody- I'm sure you guys know it, the monthly training- I read the time as 6 pm to 8 pm instead of AM. She was the one who picked up the phone when I called for clarification.  Two things:   As a new hire what're the repercussions of missing one of those meetings?

"We can improve our working conditions by working together; Obvious alt is obvious.  &#x200B;  We have some special circumstances this year that have provided us with a particularly great opportunity for the retail workforce. I want to get one rolling for this holiday season.   &#x200B;  Folks, best buy can't hire much more than teenagers and is hemorrhaging labour to places willing to pay more. They don't value us, but they NEED us. They need us for picks. They need us for sales floor. They need us for scheduling and consultation. Our leadership in store cannot help us, they're forced to further exploit us with pressure from corporate. They're forced to rely on us breaking SOP to get jobs done. We're pressured to sacrifice physical and mental well-being for them to scrape whatever extra change they can from our efforts.  &#x200B;  We are all sick of the current situation.  &#x200B;  This holiday season is OUR chance. No more masturbatory claims of being the ""hardest worker,"" no more praying for a fifty cent raise with thrice the responsibility, or getting choked up over an extra dollar an hour with a keyholder position and all of the ridiculous extra responsibilities they want to shove to us from their workload because leadership itself is now understaffed. We've all had it, from front end to the ARAs to mobile to product flow. We just need enough people at enough stores to blackout their profits. They can ignore one store stuttering. They can ignore a store in every region stuttering, but they can't ignore entire service districts going out at once. They can't ignore walkouts during the holiday season. They cannot afford to lose more of us, and to your coworkers that aren't sure where they stand, do they want to be the ones left with the extra workload when we walk out? Do they want to carry the load that corporate will carelessly force on them, demanding their sweat and blood for dimes?  &#x200B;  If you see your team walk out, you walk with them, either in solidarity, or to avoid further exploitation. You must screen yourself from the potential damage, leave with them.  &#x200B;  To the leadership out there that read this, from hourly supes to Operations to GMs, when we're all gone, corporate will put it on you. You're just as expendable",qafhhx
"all gone, corporate will put it on you. You're just as expendable as the rest of us. Salaried leadership might feel separate, but you're just as exploited. You deserve better, too. We all do.  Corporate tells us to be human? Well, how have humans survived so long? We extinguished our predators. We adapted, and then we made the environment adapt to us. We've long since passed our limit, it's time to make corporate adapt to us, and show them just how human we are.  &#x200B;  I hope the message is clear, and my coworkers do not fail to understand the tools we are provided this holiday season.

"Can‚Äôt speak for Sue but BBY laid off or demoted 5K full time workers back in January and hasn‚Äôt really made many solid efforts to do right by their workers. Our minimum pay is $15/hr company wide but they didn‚Äôt really do much to help those who were already above $15 (and then the mass layoff in January was the icing on top). Now keep in mind that COVID affected us, but financially the company was not doing badly given all it went through and stores sometimes continued to gain year over year.   Long story short, Walmart is no amazing place to work I‚Äôm sure but I‚Äôd look at BBY being more a lateral move unless stuff changes drastically here.",hfeqsm6
"You'll be expected to do the job of 4 others plus your own.  You'll get more hours if you are part time because they don't want to pay people benefits.  You'll be basically by yourself. If you're in fulfillment you're held to almost impossible pick rate times, ships, and curbside pick ups while still expected to help customers.  Most departments in the store only have 1 or 2 people working at a time.  You can find a job somewhere else that probably pays more and will give you less stress.  A lot of current Best Buy employees are overworked.  I've been with the company for almost 10 years and I am too depressed to do anything other than work, sleep, and eat.  Personally my mental health took a massive dip back in August of last year and has been declining rapidly ever since.",hfeqtc2

I know I hear so many complaints from people who call 888-BESTBUY and were told incorrect things, SOLD incorrect things, or given poor expectations for deliveries with install.

From my experience with the 3080 Ti drop you want to get there as early as possible. Our store had people lined up the day before, and from what my management said the people who got there after 3 AM were the ones who didn't get tickets, only those who were there before did. Obviously for denser metro areas I'd say you'd want to be there significantly before then even. But if you can, and if you're serious about getting one, I'd get in line as soon as possible, bring a chair/snacks/drinks, battery pack(s) for your phone/devices, and be prepared for the long haul.",h5rpwrp

"NVIDIA GPU drop on 7/20; Looks like we‚Äôre doing another in-store drop on GPUs on 7/20, all NVIDIA founders edition cards (all six SKUs). Looks like between 20-60 of each card per participating store (so about 250-300 cards total). Hopefully they‚Äôre limited to one card per person (so one person can‚Äôt get a ticket for all six).

I was there at the 3080 ti launch around 100 people lined up within the first 2-3 hours the employees where kind enough to tell the people who weren‚Äôt getting one to go home some people listened and the people who stayed well they left with broken hearts and wasted 20 hours of their time.,h5pvlkr
Do you know if stores are going to be opening up at 9 AM just like last time? Thanks for the info!,h5oi3zv

Hi! Walmart associate here!; Hello! I am a Walmart associate and I was looking into applying at Best Buy. I have love for electronics and since I can‚Äôt get into the electronics section at my store I was kinda wanting to apply. So what are the pros and cons of working for Best Buy?   Thanks in advance!,o8lx12
"Pros:   1: The discount is HELLA nice. Especially on store brand items. But even when a new game comes out, it's usually cheaper to buy it with your discount than a freshly-used copy from GS.   2: You'll usually work with some pretty decent people. I worked in Computers and my team was one of the things keeping me there.   3: Since they raised their starting wage to $15/hr, the pay is alright. I don't know if this is something they did everywhere, though.  Cons:   1: Hours. If you're not full time, you'll be fighting for them.   2: Pressure. Most of your job will be trying to sell extended warranties and the store credit card. In BB's defense, though, both their warranties and card are some of the better values in those categories.",h39bw7e
"We get a solid discount on appliances and home theater products with accommodations throughout the year usually that can be even more lucrative.

"Is there any product training for Bestbuy staff?; Hi all, I'm wondering if Bestbuy and/or manufacturers provide store employees with any training on products and if there's any kind of product knowledge testing.

Pre-COVID... yes. Now? No... the new policy seems to be maximizing profit by keeping labor to a minimum. That means no hours for any real training and no real engagement. Pre-COVID vendors came into stores and teamed up with sales teams to ensure product knowledge.,h2xedo4

That would be your fifth reason for the dip in applicants.   I also found this quote hilarious: ""*it's about a wholesome set of benefits that we can put in place*""  Really? What benefits do PT workers get? No medical/dental/vision, no PTO to speak of (but routinely near full-time hours). I guess they can buy BBY stock at a discount in the ESPP program? Wheeeeee.   And when you say ""and flexibility that we can put in place"" it rings more like you want to cut people from 39 hours to 4 hours with little notice, but also want them to come in on their scheduled days off on short notice too. How does this benefit the customer Corie? What is your endgame here?

"How my management lied to and scammed me.; So I got hired around October at age 16 to pay for my dad's heart surgery and our bills since he was our only income. I worked a steady schedule for 2 weeks, but nobody told me what to do. My co-workers had to help me get my start because management just completely forgot about me. Little did I know, the day I finished my E-Learning and got my blue shirt would be my last day there    I had worked about 8 days up until this point. As mentioned before, this would be the end. The next 2 weeks I had 0 hours scheduled. I had to come in and ask about it because nobody was returning my emails. My hiring manager told me they were cutting hours and things would be back to normal    2 more weeks passed and I still had not been scheduled, and had been informed after emailing my manager that the hour cuts were extended.    Black friday rolled around and I emailed asking if they needed me for black friday. At this point, I still had not been scheduled and nobody was returning my emails at all. About 2 weeks after black friday I came into the location because I was unable to log into the best buy app. I had emailed about this several times with no response. It is then that I found out I had been fired without even being told. The guy who checked the database and found out I was fired had no clue why, he just saw that my info was no longer in the database. I finally got in contact with my manager around January and he said to apply back in March, when they would be hiring again.    I didn't go looking for another job since he assured me that he wanted me back and it wasn't suppose to be like this. I emailed again in February to make sure I was still clear to re apply. He said yes.    Then a week ago after 3 emails, he finally responded asking my age and hours. I said 17 (because my bday had passed) and told him my hours. He responded and said that they want people who can work multiple positions and use equipment, and to wait until I'm 18.     So I had just spent half a year of my life with no income, under the assurance that I would be back to work. And don't forget that I had been secretly laid off, without being told.

"I am not a lawyer, this is not legal advice:  Try to find an employment law attorney that you can get a free consultation with to run your situation by. They should be able to look at what you‚Äôve experienced and determine if there‚Äôs anything actionable. Probably the biggest hurdle to your situation is whether or not any of this is in writing. For the initial hire there should be a paper trail and time sheets should still be available going back that far that an attorney could demand during the discovery phase. That should be able to corroborate your story up to the part where your employment was unexpectedly terminated. The conversations about getting rehired though, assuming they were all on the phone, will come down to your word against theirs. If they tell the truth, great, but if they suddenly have a different recollection it would make proving your case much harder.  Go in with notes, try and remember dates and times as best as possible while they‚Äôre still fresh-ish, and hopefully you can get something done.",gsnsdrp
"Guys, so as of March 6th-20th I was on leave because my family was hit w Covid. I checked ADP and it says $0.00.

What type of leave? Personal or medical? Or did you need to be out for quarantine? Did you test positive for Covid?

If there was any sense in the world they‚Äôd continue to let people quarantine and make testing easier to get until we‚Äôre all eligible for the vaccine.

Not sure how many would choose to just leave or change to PT, but would've meant less people would've been purged without warning.  In my department we had at least one guy that was actively wanting to be fired for some reason.  So instead of him just no call no showing and truly fucking us over schedule/appointment wise.  He could've just bounced in a way that actually removed him from our stuff.  Purge might not have been avoided, but maybe it would've.

Another Circuit City in the making; I was a lucky one and got out last October. I'm sending prayers to all my Blue Shirt family. The company has been going down hill ever since Dick Shultz left. With this last move they are doing just what Circuit City did and that's get rid of those who know what they are doing and replace them with lower paid PT. For those who don't know Circuit was the Best Buy of the East. They owned the market for years and then we moved in.     I was with this company for about 25 years and loved it.

"Why is there such an emphasis on paying middle class or even upper middle class wages to the skills most workers use in a retail store?  Best Buy, of all the retail giants, needs people with more diverse and specialized knowledge so I‚Äôm in favor of the higher hourly wages here but really, why I. The the hell are ppl going to college for years and years then go do something they could have done right out of of high school?  Why aren‚Äôt people driving trucks, going for commissioned sales, some sort of management, welding pipes, higher skilled positions in the medical fields?  Why is it such a trend to force jobs that excelling at them didn‚Äôt require a lot of practice, skill, preparation, training, or expensive education to pay the same rate that the more stressful and difficult to perform jobs do?  I‚Äôll admit it took some time for me to become really  proficient at what I do here at Specialty S but it‚Äôs NOWHERE NEAR the stress and strife of my previous sales territory management.  I will never say there isn‚Äôt stress at BBUY but one of the many reasons I would never go for a management position is - despite the fact that I‚Äôd love to make the money they make - I do NOT want the responsibility.",gqa3m4l
"Oh I definitely think Best Buy workers should make more than the minimum. Especially with them wanting employees to be experts at EVERYTHING. The only truly entry level positions should be truck and front lanes positions, everything else should start higher.   I also think those other jobs should pay more, I think the minimum wage being as low as it‚Äôs been for so long has depressed wages overall. Raising the minimum will force those other salaries up because, as you say, who would do those jobs if they can work anywhere and make $15/hour? The added job security people will have knowing they can make $15 would let people who do make more leave toxic workplaces without having to give up their mortgage for example.

I refuse to let them keep doing myself and my co-workers so dirty.  All they have to do is ""be human"" and stop abusing us all.  It really isn't hard to just keep in mind that we are people that deserve respect.  They have done shockingly positive things for us workers even just 5 years ago.  So I know it can be done.  What they are doing now is causing burn outs and isn't sustainable given the ways they are cutting staff and effectively making full-timers the same as part-timers with regard to hours.  The way they are going is a great way to make quick money for the top, but will drop hard in the future.  When we are fired because of this, then I fail to see what is worth not doing something.  We will maybe get some small severances, while they will get multi-million dollar ones.  I am guessing that they are trying to somehow be acquired by Amazon with the drastic changes.  If we are being picked off, then we should be coming together and push back.  Believe it or not, I do like the company and want all of us to share in successes that can be had.  Harsh critiques are not always from hate, but many times are because you care and want to make things better.  So I know you care too.",gmw9k20

The thing that sucks is they put a cap on how much we can make and if your like me your already maxed out and it sucks.

Geeksquad plan; Hello if anyone at here works at Best Buy can they tell me what I can damage for my geeksquad plan? I bought a 3 year plan for a 1300$ computer and the plan was 269 for 3 years. If I don‚Äôt use it can someone tell me some sort of scam I can do to get a store credit towards a new one. The employees told me I can do that.,ktqdd1
Computers are far more difficult to get a payout for. They must be sent out for repair rather than a payout and fall under the lemon policy where it can be sent out up to 3 times for the same problem before considering a junk out/pay out. The device would have to be far beyond repair and not cost effective to be considered a junk out on the first trip. Read the terms of the protection policy closely because the device is only covered under normal use so claiming it fell out of your monster truck and smashed into unimaginable amounts of pieces would not be covered. Also keep in mind the repair process can take weeks per trip depending on how busy it is,gintys4

Union Activities; I was wondering with the recent cut in labor everywhere and the outstanding company performance. Is anyone thinking Unions due to the extreme labor cuts and cuts to many other benefits. I know we all get paid $15 now but that doesn‚Äôt matter when most of us are getting no hours. Curious I am.,k127qt
A union doesn't equal guaranteed hours at all.,gdlsb0i
Union contracts routinely include minimum hour ranges. If they can force grocery store chains to respect employee time surely they can get an electronics store chain to.,gdmajgw
They can if they want.,gdlwkq5
And if that becomes a thing you can bet your qss before rhe union comes in layoffs will happen very quickly. If its mandated you must have so many hours per employee it will be fine have less employees.,gdman3i
If you think corprate would pass a contract with that your dreaming.,gdlxa9h
"What most grocery contracts require is so many full time positions and so many part time positions. Full timers usually are required to be scheduled at least 37 hours or something similar, with part timers scheduled at least 20 hours. Union contracts also typically include show-up/minimum pay so you don‚Äôt get screwed with short shifts (most contracts make exclusions for up to X store meetings per year).   And yes, while it sucks, we really shouldn‚Äôt have so many employees. They don‚Äôt have enough hours to justify it, and a contract would enforce the point so the company would have to learn to live with the employees they have and only hire when there‚Äôs a genuine need.",gdmckxj

So I am about to finish my elearning and just wanted to know what happens after that and how much Best Buy expects you to have mastered. One thing in really worries about is it all just felt like walls of text where once they talked about one subject they moved on and it was never touched on again. I don‚Äôt know if elearning is just to get familiar with the concepts or if they do expect us to have memorized things like all the different memberships and levels of memberships and cost and customer pickup and all the other things elearning teaches.

I really just need confirmation of time period to wait until I start getting antsy to go into store.,jwlmpz
Even if you go into the store there is a very high likelihood that not a single employee of that store will know anything about your particular order in this case. Corporate is a shrouded mystery to best buy employees everywhere and they don't really have a good way of informing stores when they are doing exceptions for orders. The items just sort of show up and are marked to be picked for the order within 30 minutes of receiving them in inventory,gcs9hbp

"Retaliation Prevention Policy: A Former Employee Story; I began my employment at one of Orlando‚Äôs Best Buy stores in 2018. Following a year after, I was sexually harassed by my supervisor in late 2019. After reporting that incident, my employment at Best Buy took the worst of turns.  While the store as a whole could agree that my supervisor‚Äôs overall behavior at work was questionable (just before being promoted as my supervisor, he had been documented for threatening to physically harm a customer.), his sales for the store were competitively high.  My former supervisor had the highest amount of Total Tech Support sales out of all the employees in the store, while his moods were not always pleasant, he was a crucial part of the team since he helped carry the store‚Äôs revenue.  During his short time as my supervisor, he crossed several boundaries which led to his termination. I do want to mention that during the process, the human resources representative assigned to my case during the investigation asked me a question which to this day, I cannot agree with.  *‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you say something sooner?‚Äù*  This question does not feel sincere, but rather similar to an accusation. Talking about sexual harassment, sexual assault, rape, or any misconduct of that matter, is not an easy subject to open up about. Asking why a victim didn‚Äôt rush to speak out feels like a shift of blame. I hope in the future, companies begin to ask more appropriate questions that are more productive to their investigation.  My personal take: Never question the victim‚Äôs motives. If you are curious, here‚Äôs the answer- we are attempting to cope with whatever trauma we were forced to face.  After the termination of my supervisor, different managers began to share with me that the General Manager of the store was no longer fond of me. I was aware that his behavior towards me had changed. I think about the sexual harassment investigation, remembering my GM‚Äôs reaction when he sat next to me during a conference call with human resources.  I told the representative that I had shared with my coworkers the sexual harassment incidents that I had faced. I explained to the representative that I did not feel comfortable with the management at my store, which is why I never came to them. There had been a previous conflict that had occurred in my department which management had not handled professionally.  When I shared this information with the representative, I watched my GM bury his face into the palms of his hands. My intention was never to embarrass the GM or the training of",j5vbke
"palms of his hands. My intention was never to embarrass the GM or the training of his staff, but to express to human resources why I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable confiding in management.  A few days after the termination of my supervisor, I had shared with my GM and the human resources team that I had a concern about an employee who is a family member of my former supervisor. He was a seasonal employee and was had a close relationship with my former supervisor, as they lived together and shared a car. During a casual conversation that I once had with him, he has shared with me that he had been in and out of jail for improper conduct regarding violent behavior.  I shared that conversation with my GM and expressed to him my fear of physical harm or retaliation from this employee. My GM responded to me, ‚Äúhe is seasonal, which means we don‚Äôt have to move forward with him. If I were you, I wouldn‚Äôt worry about it.‚Äù  This had given me peace of mind, until weeks later when I discovered that my GM kept him in the store with a promotion as a full-time employee.  I had felt so deceived by my own General Manager and I no longer felt safe working at the store.  Thinking about the days that followed, my dynamic with my GM changed. He began ignoring me at work. It was very uncomfortable to go into work, walking past each other while making eye-contact, and there being no acknowledgment from him. During some instances, I would be the bigger person and say hello or good morning, but when I did, I was blatantly ignored.  I changed my mindset and accepted that I would come into work to help clients and to stay out of my GM‚Äôs way. There did come a point where I was overwhelmed by how often management was warning me about his growing dislike towards me.  In addition, some of the management would tell me that my GM would persistently ask about my performance. They were told that if I was caught doing something that came remotely close to violating policy, to report the incident to my GM immediately. While this is a fair request, asking management to overlook their staff, why was I being targeted specifically? This had made me feel as if my General Manager wanted to ensure that I was under scrutiny.  I‚Äôve always been the person to hear bad news and to stay in a state of shock. I never questioned the management who‚Äôd warned me about my GM. I always nodded my head",j5vbke
"I never questioned the management who‚Äôd warned me about my GM. I always nodded my head and absorbed the information, never wanting to continue a conversation about how I was potentially in a hostile work environment. To talk about it, was to acknowledge that it existed.  One day, I developed the courage to ask a manager . . .  Me: ‚ÄúHey, do you know why it is that \[my GM\] doesn‚Äôt like me?‚Äù  Manager: ‚ÄúDid you ever see \[your former supervisor\]‚Äôs numbers?‚Äù  Me: ‚ÄúI guess, but he wasn‚Äôt a good employee, I thought?‚Äù  Manager: ‚ÄúRight, but you reported a problem that brought HR to fly in from out of state. That doesn‚Äôt make \[your GM\] look good in front of HR.‚Äù  After that answer, I knew at that moment that this was never going to end; my General Manager would see it through to have me terminated.  I received a disciplinary action form some weeks after my supervisor‚Äôs termination: a final warning. An employee had come to the store on their day off wanting to exchange a product that had been at an ex-boyfriends house, she had finally been able to retrieve it and wanted to upgrade it to something of a higher quality. I considered that Best Buy‚Äôs management always made exceptions outside of the return/exchange policy for customer satisfaction (this exception is a case-by-case decision).  Considering how I was told to look at out-of-policy transactions (to make exceptions for customers who are willing to spend more money during the exchange process.), I asked a nearby manager if my coworker could exchange an item that was out of policy. After the manager had approved the transaction, I was pulled into the GM‚Äôs office days later signing my first, final warning.  I had pondered for days wondering if having a manager‚Äôs approval still deemed the situation to be a violation of policy. My days of wondering ended soon after I was told that the write up was given solely to ensure that it was on my Best Buy employee record.  One of the managers shared with employees that the GM, being general manager, had the authority to choose the severity of the write-up. Managers shared with employees that my General Manager wanted to ensure that I was put on a final warning.  I had a coworker call me after my shift that day, explaining that they felt that my write up was a form of retaliation. This was an employee",j5vbke
"day, explaining that they felt that my write up was a form of retaliation. This was an employee who I had not shared any information about my investigation case or how I had been feeling ignored by my GM. However, before ending the call, the employee vowed to report their observations to Best Buy‚Äôs human resources.  I approached my GM the following week asking him to look into transferring me to another Best Buy location, but he never followed up with me as promised.  Months later, I called human resources to finally open up about my fear of retaliation from my General Manager. Human resources took note of my statement and opened a case, but they never reached out to me again after that phone call.  It would be wishful thinking to believe that this is all he-said, she-said, work nonsense. However, after having six different managers in the store confirm that my General Manager had it out for me, wishful thinking would be ignorance.  I am currently a former Best Buy employee. I do wonder at times, maybe if I had stopped my coworkers from making that call to Best Buy‚Äôs human resources department about my sexual harassment concern with my supervisor, I might still work for Best Buy. Perhaps I would‚Äôve had the opportunity to leave on a good note, with the option of having my general manager as a reference for any future work opportunities. But I‚Äôve come to accept that this isn‚Äôt my reality. Best Buy is now a closed chapter of my life.  My purpose for this lengthy reflection is for people to know the truth. The journey to creating a positive work environment for victims who have reported sexual harassment has a long way to go. In a place where I once called my second home, it became the place where I was scared to go to work and where I didn‚Äôt feel the support and acceptance from my management team.  I do not discourage women or men that want to report harassment in the workplace, once it‚Äôs seen through, it can be a sense of relief. However, I strongly urge people to know that in reporting these concerns, there are consequences that we must face. It is a challenging part of being a victim.  I wish that no one ever has to face half of the battles that I have had to when it‚Äôs come to sexual harassment in the workplace, but if you are faced with it, I hope that you choose wisely and do what is ultimately best for you.",j5vbke

I have the best buy membership and signed up with the student deals. When I purchased it, they took:  -$100.00 OFF SALE  -$150.00 EDUCATION DISCOUNT  -$75.00 10% BIRTHDAY DISCOUNT   So I was able to save over $300 dollars. Im interested in going back and purchasing an iPad when it comes on sale and when I get my birthday coupon again. Can someone confirm that this was done properly?

"So where did my store go wrong with masks?; Masks are required, as part of company policy and by order of the state my store operates in. From reading other posts in the other sub, it seems most stores have a ‚Äúhost‚Äù who turns away people who try to enter without a mask. Our store has an AP, and even though we‚Äôve never really had issues with shrink/theft, our AP people are just basically doing their usual AP things.   Initially leaders were very hands on with engaging people who made it past AP to let them know they wouldn‚Äôt be assisted if they refused to wear a mask. However, lately they‚Äôre saying employees that are ‚Äúcomfortable‚Äù assisting people without masks may do so. I asked for an SOP or other communication where it said that was an option and nothing was produced.   So... is my store leadership just being greedy and being unsafe on purpose? Or are other stores doing this too? I don‚Äôt feel comfortable helping people without a mask and when I was told we were reopening my GM assured me it would be done safely, but I have a household member who is at risk for this. And it feels like it isn‚Äôt being taken seriously..  Anyone else experiencing this?",i1p9b9
"All stores should be running the host model and informing the client about the mask policy. If a client refuses to wear a mask, we just inform them that they are free to walk the store but they will not be assisted by an employee during their visit. If you do not feel comfortable helping a customer because they refuse to follow the mask policy, that is completely your right. If a situation becomes escalated, it is MOD discretion on how to proceed but the same should follow.",g05e302

That‚Äôs not the problem I have with it, and I‚Äôll never feel bad because someone else is doing better.  That all being said, I do think corporate should have handled the increases for people who are already above $15 that fought to earn their raises better. 4% is pretty weak. It should have been 4% + 1% per year of service up to five years, then an additional 0.5% per year of service up to five years, and finally an additional 0.25% per year of service beyond that (no limit). Someone with ten years would get 11.5%. Someone with fifteen years would get 12.75%. And so on.   And I still think sales associates should have some kind of commission pay. Would it be ideal? No. Would it cause there to be some infighting? Sure. But it‚Äôs not really fair to the really excellent salespeople who crush it on apps and routinely turn out multimillion dollar years to rely on the limited ‚Äúrock star‚Äù raises some leaders dole out.   But a sliding scale percentage would address most long term employees grievances and make them feel more appreciated. Otherwise why stay with Best Buy?",hwbdxn

"One thing I didn‚Äôt account for at the time is that there is apparently an additional 3% applied at your next yearly review on top of whatever you get there. So worst case you get no yearly increase from your review, you‚Äôd still see an extra 3%.   And as it‚Äôs a 2-step increase (first your yearly increase if any is applied, THEN the 3% increase) it accounts for whatever your review adds to the number.

"The data seems mixed on surface transmission. I know they reined in the initial idea that it could live on surfaces for days, but even if it only lives for hours, that's still enough time to expose multiple people on things like demo laptops, demo tablets and demo keyboards.  It still seems safer regardless if everyone wears masks in enclosed areas. If we were working outdoors with more space, I'd be all for going maskless tho (especially in sunlit days).",fto2839

"Appointment visits; So in principal these sound good, but there have been a number of problems at my location:  1. People going over their appointment time limit (it's in half hour blocks). 2. People being vague in their notes about what the appointment is about (had a customer that came in for a visit in car audio, that ended up adding on some mobile stuff which extended their visit to an hour). 3. Apparently masks are optional for customers. 4. And even though customers are supposed to be hands off, they're still touching things despite being told not to, and that makes the post visit clean up time consuming.  I really wish we required masks though. No medical exceptions (because there aren't any which doctors have freely admitted). We also shouldn't schedule visits towards closing time (when curbside inevitably gets busier). Last appointment should be an hour before close (with the half hour visit ending a half hour before close).  It would also be nice if the scheduler provided a way to block off more time for customers that may need it (I guess you could double book someone to achieve the same effect though).",gin14r

Best Buy Reports Large Scale Store Shutdowns As Businesses Brace For Retail Bankruptcies,12r8ob9
Ok,jgthayf
It‚Äôs a bit theatrical and overdramatized but there are some interesting numbers they quote. This kind of stuff (these doomsday type media) on here (Reddit) I feel only tends to create a sense of mass hysteria and doesn‚Äôt do anybody any good. But maybe that‚Äôs just me.,jgtiehu
I mean the numbers paint a pretty clear picture of what‚Äôs to come‚Ä¶.,jgtl8wy
"I hear you, and I agree it‚Äôs foreshadowing the retail future. But I‚Äôm more interested in what people are doing about it all. By no means am o saying keep it like it used to be or fix it so it doesn‚Äôt die. What is everyone involved proactively doing about their own situation? Maybe there are some strategies to share or very good collections of what not to do.   I like getting people serious about this situation, but maybe not in this format. I just can‚Äôt stand when this stuff pops up in this format but then doesn‚Äôt offer any balance or insight to the other side of the coin (that being what is everyone doing).  Let‚Äôs just hypothetically say Best Buy closes for good 3 - 6 months from now. Can‚Äôt say that the writing wasn‚Äôt on the wall, right? So what did you (hypothetically) as a current tenure of at least 4 or 5 year employee - at the time of closure - do about it? What could you have done? If you skated by thinking it‚Äôll happen way later but are now unemployed - what do you do now? Can you do anything about it? I‚Äôm talking of course on the personal level - forget the macro stuff like banking reform, economic reform, etc. It‚Äôs beyond your personal influence in that short amount of time.",jgtp3ij

Best Buy Credit Card Question; What factors go into getting a customer approved for the BBY credit card aside from credit score?,12woa5a
Yearly income.,jhick91
"Okay, and one more thing if you're able to help.    When I try to do the practice interview, it says my camera is not detected. Everything appears to be on in my settings and there isn't any block on the search engine. I'm not sure what's going on.",jhflect
Debt to income ratio is huge.  I've also noticed that trying to get approved with a credit score under 700 is near impossible for the BBY card.  Easily 90% of my clients that apply get denied.,jhimwlg
"Make sure the manager fills out an incident form.   Then go to a doctor.  Make sure the doc does thorough testing to determine if the damage is permanent or not.  Take it from me, I hurt my back on the salesfloor back when we used to sell Sony WEGA TVs. The company will try every which way to avoid admitting blame and $$$ you may be entitled to.  Get everything in writing!",jhinc6n
Approval odds are like 12%. Anyone under 720'ish is not getting approved. I've seen people get approved for the gold card if they put in 50K-60K+ for their yearly though,jhjbtvq
Best buy credit cards are issued by Citibank. You have to have well established credit in all categories.    If you are and do not get approved it's probably because you have a Citi card already.,jhmaiwe
Wondering if this is appliances managers too.,jhmaxkd
"My 2nd day on registers, someone purchased a grill brush. That was weird.",jhmjzty

"Need advice; I have the A+ cert and want to apply to best buy, preferably Geek squad.  They have an advanced repair agent and a floor sales position available.

You‚Äôre already over qualified. Most people are hired with zero experience or qualifications,jhq2a9d
As a GSM üòä I only hire people with repair experience. Front and back. It really depends on the manger,jhqp3jd

All the changes supposedly to ""placate the shareholders"" were made BY those shareholders and all of them are looking to make a windfall when Best Buy is ultimately sold, no matter that the company itself will be basically destroyed.  I've been saying this will happen for years and it is playing out exactly as predicted: Corie hamstrings the stores to drive away customers intentionally so she can close stores to save overhead, but the exaggerated numbers for online sales never materialize and things get worse overall: rinse repeat, and with every cycle Best Buy, gets weaker and smaller. Notice that the most dire company information in that video (and elsewhere) comes from Coire's own reports? That's no accident. She's intentionally killing the company so she and the board can jump with their platinum parachutes when it finally flounders completely and what few workers are left get screwed even more.",jhxjuvg

Retail supervisors will be restructured into Experience supervisors. Pay grade 12.   Every store gets a different amount of headcount for experience supervisors the most being 3 for the hub store.

Same with the GMs. They were not offered severance unless there wasn‚Äôt a location left for you to go.,ji4xj1d
Thats what im trying to know. No severance is fucked up.,ji4yry1
"So, to get out of severance, they can simply ""restructure"" as a company?",ji51goh
Well what they did with the GMs was an assignment based on preferences. The DMs got the same treatment. Because it‚Äôs an assignment and not job elimination severance is not option even if you were to decline your assignment. Severance was an option if all equal and available jobs are filled leaving a person displaced.,ji52hqh
"Honestly, this is where this stuff should be posted anyways because everything gets taken down on the other one.",ji7j1q8
Agreed. The problem is employees don‚Äôt know about this subreddit. And I wouldn‚Äôt doubt Best Buy would try and take over this one too.,ji7m9a0

"$16. Don‚Äôt listen to others who are saying ‚Äúask for max‚Äù, because they aren‚Äôt going to give it to you.",jiib4zl
Pay impacts nothing except PNL leaders bonus off of a company pnl so giving advisors max dollar has almost no negative impact on a case to case based. So if you believe you are worth it ask for it.  Not to mention Best Buy isn‚Äôt that competitive in pay around the country so we have to pay employees near the top dollar in my area to retain them.  Also max should be either 17.49 or 18.27,jiieyqq
"This really depends on the pay at other retailers in your area. I know in my area they start external (new) hire VPLs 50 cents below cap with limited experience. Technically some local restaurants actually pay better than us right now at max cap, so it can‚Äôt hurt to ask if other retailers are being competitive.

Yes because we over paid a bunch of consultants to sell things that have no margin. When I have advisors who sell the same thing as consultants for 5 dollars an hour less and no commission.

Only things that I know are true are leadership is being evaluated again. There are two new positions but I have no details of them other than pay a services experience manager (salary at what most ASMs are now) and a services experience supervisor ( higher pay grade than current GSMs).

Oh and don't believe anything corp says. I've been around for 30 years here and I've seen them outright lie to leadership, too many times to count in fact, during a restructure. One of the many reasons I never accepted any promotion they threw at me. I've seen so many managers, at every level, get fired or restructured that it would make your head spin. I fell for their lies once and left services for a couple years to help them run the salesfloor. I got sick of their lies and took a demotion to go back into services. I was not about to let their lackluster leadership turn me into a selfish virtue signaling prick, which is what you have to become, apparently, in order to advance in this company.",jjbx5in

Ad prices and things listed on our main page get ‚Äúspiffs‚Äù for the company when sold so although our direct cost is not impacted or changed for that product we make more from the vendors.

New Position; For all those wondering the SEM position will be a salaried position at pay grade 5e which is what ASM is currently at. This position will involve traveling between the stores within the micro market in your own personal vehicle and no gas card with what I‚Äôve been told will be 3 days at one location and the other two days at the other locations which will rotate every week.,13jrye3
"No gas card but mileage from the hub. And this isn‚Äôt accurate, the SEM will be what the micro makes it. Could be 1 day at each store, 2 at the hub. Whatever works. The whole purpose of a micro is for it to be fluid and unique to its micro needs.",jkguyn3

No application. Here is the situation . Your salaried leaders just got cut, if you are not the hub you don‚Äôt have two ASMs anymore. So that person is going to need a job.

Negotiating Open Box pricing on Mac Studio @ Best Buy; I‚Äôm a former Best Buy employee from a few years ago. Worked on the sales floor and at Geek Squad as a CA. I know things has changed and one of those changes include how open box prices are generated. It used to be every store had different prices; lowering the price every week it doesn‚Äôt sell. But now they mirror online open box prices. What are the chances I can negotiate the pricing on a Mac Studio M1 Max 512GB open box in my area? It‚Äôs likely not to sell in the area as it‚Äôs not particularly a wealthy or even popular area.  The drive is a hour drive and I don‚Äôt want to drive out there to not be able to get it.,13nu7mm

I think some of the cuts in the Enterprise side is to help fund a big push on the Health side as we are expected to start out pacing Enterprise and are expanding rapidly.,jmv84vr

New to best buy as a full time mobile employee and I have some questions.; So I‚Äôm new to Best Buy this is2nd week and I‚Äôm catching on pretty fast the e learning has been a pain in the ass but so far it‚Äôs a interesting job to have but I was wondering like how do people become a Apple specialist I‚Äôm currently in training to replace someone who is going to college and he is a apple specialist he told me that it was some type of e-Learning that he had to but I was wondering exactly how do you get to that point.

"Recieved an offer, what should I expect?; I was nearly unemployed for almost 2 years. Didn't even get offers from McDonald's and clothing stores like old navy. I had a background in IT. Did 3 interviews with best buy. Got an offer.   They believe in me. I'm going to try my best to live up to expectations lol.   Just writing this out to tell people. Interestingly,I don't think I even have good communication skills and see myself as an awkward person lol. Sales is the last place I thought I'd be.  Anyways, thoughts? What should I expect? I know people say bad things but since best buy and my manger who was nice in the interview process believe in me I'm going to work my best even despite bad customers.",13zqf5q

"Everything everyone says her is true. The reason you are also most likely having a hard time getting jobs in IT is because they are being scooped up by Best Buy, more so geek squad employees because of how bad the direction of the company is. IT Companies like someone who works with customers. Don‚Äôt get me wrong IT knowledge is good and still necessary but soft skills are harder to teach. So when someone who has worked retail and has IT background applies for an IT job they are likely to get it, provided it‚Äôs you know within their capabilities. So yes use this time get about 8 months to a year in and then start applying. For now Best Buy, more so geeksquad still has a decent reputation, but I‚Äôll be honest I feel that is starting to dwindle to the point companies maybe only looking at seasoned employees with several years under their belt.

"It‚Äôs sad; best buy laying off sups/gsm that made the store a better place who cared about customers and fellow employees is really sad. i know that‚Äôs an obvious statement but i cannot imagine my store without these leaders. with the supervisors they decided to keep, i do not see how my store can be a great place to go as a customer and work as an employee.. leftover supervisors have barely any product knowledge, and some barely even know how to work POS. gm sits in the sdr all day and complains about working register to cover a break. the people they have chosen for shift lead do not care about leading employees and most definitely are not fit to answer an MoD call. also new hires knowing jack shit about anything and still getting paid more than people who have been there the longest. it‚Äôs so sad, i loved best buy but everyday it just gets worse and worse",141fcm8
"Advice needed!; Good morning all!   I have been seeing a lot of helpful tips around here and looking for more. I worked for Best Buy for 8 years‚Ä¶ I have become one of the recognizable people to district as I lead 70% of the walks (as a sup!) I knew sales, operations, etc. none of that mattered as I am one of the sups they let go‚Ä¶. Currently on my two week hiatus and I have the option of taking a pay cut for CIA senior OR commuting 2 hours a day to a sister store.

Can y‚Äôall help me out and let me know what jobs you applied for/got when you left bby?",141inu6
"Companies value the training you have received at Best Buy more they do. Driving 2 hours is insane unless you are planning moving you shouldn‚Äôt consider that option. If you got offered severance consider taking it. If not look for something outside of Best Buy. Jobs to look at sales (b2b or consumer) customer support. Tech support, banking, insurance.",jn09cbz
Any news about cutting sales employees in coming weeks?; Just heard from a coworker that it might happen,142l7gq
"No, the reason for the leadership cuts and higher end leaders like DM is to add 2 million hours onto the sales floor.",jn59etq
"No, they're adding more sales employees. It's possible they could restructure sales advisors in the future and bring back individual departments, but it would happen in a test market first.",jn5aqho
Nope. This is the finaly cut on layoffs until we hear anything else through the cracks. Stores will officially have more store labor hours to maximize the new store hour.,jn5k0t2

Finally had enough of the straight borderline verbal abuse from upper management and pressure of TT and BP, so I'm jumping ship. No backup plans, but funny enough I'm very happy with this decision.

PTO; Do I get my pay statement for PTO this payroll or the next? Because I have over 50 hrs of PTO that I haven‚Äôt used since I‚Äôve left,143ixlp
Dang I told my manager that I will be coming back to Best Buy in a month but I record is says terminated. That‚Äôs strange,jna9go2
"Are you asking if you get that paid out after you had left? If so, and depending on the state, that unused PTO won't be paid out.",jna2ci4
There is no federal or state law in Florida requiring private employers to pay out an employee's accrued vacation or other paid time off (PTO) at the time of termination.,jna41e5
PTO is used by employees. Once you sign the separation papers you can't use it,jnaapbt

A quick search says Florida(your state of employment) does not have a local law mandating to payout pto so you lose it,jna96rm
"I submitted my video interview, what now?; As the title says, I applied to work retail at my local Best Buy and submitted my video interview. As of yet, they haven‚Äôt gotten back to me. Should I go to the store and ask about it in person? Please lmk any advice you have.",143yid0
We don‚Äôt have enough managers to get anything done so it will be awhile before you hear from anyone,jncuo1t

ü§°,jnjwjdm
"Video interview; So I really suck at these awfully designed one way video interviews, I applied for a ft position where Im currently working and have been there pt for a couple years. I was curious if they take you being a current employee at your location into account and have all your information on hand like your time spent there, your role and etc (the person who combs through the video interviews)",1456sxm
"The person who views those interview videos would typically be whatever sup/manger normally does the hiring for your store. At my store, that was me since my area was customer service/front end. When it came to internal employees (at my store), I just clicked through  and the pushed it through. The video interviews are really not that great at gaging talent.",jnje23z
Do yourself a favor and meet the leadership in person. Introduce yourself and try to make a good impression.   Leadership usually already has a candidate in mind whenever they open up a position on JOS. You want to be that person.,jnjr5yg
"Why is every store being picky with hiring me as a transfer? I've gone through application after application and no call back.; I'm moving cities and have submitted about a dozen applications total to all local Best Buys in my new area so that I would have income, yet not one of them have made any significant progress. I've only had one interview, only to no longer be considered soon after.  I have about 3 weeks before I move so I need to plan my 2 week notice at my store accordingly. Why is everyone being picky? I guess better to hire a new person at minimum wage than to hire someone with a higher pay? Should I be working with my store's management on this transfer? Worst case I just stop working for BBY altogether, which kinda seems like a win.",146p5ca
"It could also be the stores you are applying to lost the only leader that knew how to work kenexa. Send an email to the leaders explaining your situation, experience, and why you‚Äôd be a good fit for the team.",jnrq6j6
Did they reach out to your GM for feedback? Maybe you need to start there,jnrdw2v
"As a former manager who has both been the employee transferring AND also been on the hiring side of transfers ‚Ä¶ the application and interview almost don‚Äôt matter. Whether you‚Äôll be successful transferring stores is going to come down to the communication between your direct manager and/or GM and the store you‚Äôre trying to transfer to. Speak with your direct manager/GM and see if they‚Äôve spoken to the GM at the new locations you‚Äôre trying to get hired at. If they haven‚Äôt, ask them to reach out on your behalf because you‚Äôre not getting anywhere. If they have reached out and you aren‚Äôt being hired for open spots, then they likely didn‚Äôt share great things about you unfortunately and that will make it incredibly tough to land a spot.",jnrpt47
So it‚Äôs my understanding that transfers are no longer a thing.  It‚Äôs how the company gets around paying above what the local area pay scales are.  Also as I‚Äôm sure you know the whole company is going through a reorganization when it comes to management staff so like in my store hiring is not a priority.,jnsaxl5
"What job are you trying to do? What does your performance look like?  If they pull up your numbers and they are trash, they are not going to waste their time.",jnsnjlk
Comes down to your boss. Hopefully you told them you were trying to transfer. Because the first thing anyone looking at a transfer app is to reach out to their current boss and ask about them. If that boss didn't know they were transferring that throws a big red flag.,jnt2b0y
When I transferred my former GM and former C & D manager both reached out the GM of the store I wanted to transfer to. I also reached out the area marketplace director to introduce myself. I went from a video interview to immediately a job offer asking when I can start. Depending on which store needs what presents an opportunity,jntxzox

Naturally, police came by to question my gm but noticed he did not have tattoos so they want on their way.

They recently did a restructure and let go of a lot of supervisor positions. There‚Äôs a good chance whomever was doing the hiring was let go. Or they‚Äôre waiting on your background check to clear.

They can speak quickly to any product that comes up there, and henceforth are able to usually tie in TT or a CC better than those without seasoned product knowledge.      75 to 90 Percent of all customers seem to check out at front end/lanes. You don't want your worst in there. Better to send those who struggleto the floor, learn the products and get comfortable selling TT and CC's long form. Only way you get GREAT at the short form pitch required at front end, is if you've garnered the skills of the long form pitch.

"It's possible... Sometimes things take immediate effect, sometimes things don't get processed correctly due to the fact that the senior leaders got let go....and replaced with shift leads who don't have the experience of the sups and managers who got snapped.

"I'm trying that, HR phone number is down or at least it says the call can't be completed and my gm hasn't gotten back to me. So frustrating.",jo0xjfq

"100% agree with this. Intent means everything. I‚Äôd also suggest asking what this shift lead will be responsible for. We have a shift lead that sounds similar to this person.

"Y'all should unionize; Title. Got fired this morning after 5 and a half years, I was a PC DA.",1499vuh
If there's anything I've learned in retail it's that the majority of employees have little to no capability to use strength in numbers. So my policy is that once I see the signs of problems then my goal is to fuck those above me before they fuck me.,jo406r5
What we need to do is take our talent/skills and find a better paying job. The company is already imploding with the loss of experienced employees and filling those roles with shift leads who weren‚Äôt good enough to be promoted in the past and giving them a pseudo leadership role. They‚Äôre hiring kids off the street who can‚Äôt keep up with all the product knowledge they have to learn because they have to know a little bit about everything we sell.

They know unions are the correct solution to their behaviour, now they're trying as hard as possible to make sure not enough people realize that soon enough to do something. This also may be part of why they're letting leaders go first (and pay ofc).

"I don't want to get into details, but tldr;  Recently (1\~2 years ago so I guess not super recent) promoted to PC DA, started out okay lots of work and I could assist the Appliance dudes when necessary, but following an accident I could no longer assist deliveries, then changes to TT lost us tons of clients, eventually leading to months of little to no work, some days my whole team had several hours between appointments.I complained to our DFM, and he recommended we try and make sales at the store, pull appointments etc, but due to hostility between our local store and field leadership it was difficult to work at the store beyond helping in the precinct. Then following a vehicular accident, wherein I was effectively stuck hours from home, sheltering in a Walmart for 7 hours from extreme weather. After getting home I became disconnected with things and eventually began utilizing my downtime to go home, work off my company laptop, do pre-calls, etc from home, after a while I gave up on trying to pretend to be busy and just procrastinated.  I won't argue that I was justified in wasting company time, as they put it, but transitioning from a 40-50hr work week to maybe 28hrs screwed me over financially, on top of the ongoing physical and emotional burnout from the job. I made poor decisions, but I also feel like I along with the rest of my team are being set up to fail.

Am I crazy?; Can we talk about the change in job grades ans caps?   How is it that customer service and sales floor can potentially make more money than SWAT? They have one of the most intense and stessful jobs in the store. Why are they paid as high as a manager or closer to it? Their job is to manage inventory. They technically do PI every day.   Make this make sense.,14a61km
I believe this has been a thing for several years now. Advisors were upgraded from pay grade 3 to pay grade 4 when we moved hourly wages to 15. And pay grade 5 was removed when we lost BOL and FEL.  Now I was recently let go from the last restructure (consultant and designer supervisor 12 years) and if something has changed in the last two weeks GS CA/ Advisor/ PFlow/Swat/ VPL are all the same pay grade. The next step up would be a consultant at 9 which is more then an ARA.,jo8voa9

All entry level spots got moved to pay grade 4 (Pf, Advisors, VPL, and GS CA)when the company made $15 the minimum.   So SWAT and every other entry level spot are the same. It's not that they make more money by default. In my area, they all max out at $18.22. That is not near what management make unless you get low balled as a manager or supervisor  Personally, I think SWAT should be pay grade 5 due to the fact that they are constantly researching, keeping contact with other stores and the warehouse, and just straight up managing the entire inventory integrity. SWAT is the inventory control leader in its own right. I would never do that job though lol  The next store level positions to get a pay bump currently after getting rid of FEL and BOL would be consultant (pay grade 9), senior consultant (Pay grade 11), GS senior (Pay grade 9), and  GS ARA (Pay grade 8) that is not management",jo8z4hm
Inventory has been getting the shaft pretty hard among all of these cuts and restructures,jo922if
So all you do is manage inventory? You don't deal with customers? Got it.,jo8rz75
Damn how much $ different is it now lol,jo8ydy7
"I like the way you think. SWATs should easily be equal to or greater than Supervisors easily and the fact they havent increased the pay cap is a joke. Even after they raised everyone to the $15minimum still didnt increase cap. People dont realize that without a SWAT properly doing their job, the sales floor has nothing to sell. The amount of increased revenue a SWAT generates just by doing their job should easily result in higher pay. The reason you sell that open box laptop or TV is because of SWAT.",jo979fw
The classic Warehouse vs. Sales Floor. You're all pretty and are important for the store to succeed.,jo8t4bd

I‚Äôm already thinking of leaving; I‚Äôve been working in the warehouse for maybe 2 months and it is the most physically and mentally draining job I‚Äôve had and I‚Äôve had 40 hour a week job that was more manual labor then being in the warehouse.

"so like‚Ä¶. is it wage theft?; not that we can really get away with much as this company likes to silence us in many ways, but does it get to wage theft at one point? or did they already change the whole system and positions for PF being that omni bs and cheat us out so that we can‚Äôt complain? pretty fun being PF/WH only to be threatened with termination every day/time we don‚Äôt follow ‚Äúnew company procedures‚Äù and hop on sales, etc, then hop back to PF closing duties alone while all the sales floor leaves as soon as store closes, all just to be paid the wages of one job title. you know, the usual mess that now seems to be the norm",14bnt21
We have our store meeting today. I‚Äôm in the WH and I guarantee that if we‚Äôre told to be pseudo sales people I‚Äôm out. PF/WH has so many things to do as is we don‚Äôt have time to be yelled at because some older person doesn‚Äôt know what ink goes in the printer they bought 4 years ago.,joghtk4
"In the job description, I do believe it says ""and other duties as assigned"" which is how they'll get away with it, and this will never be considered wage-theft.  Examples of wage-theft: ""Wage theft occurs when employers do not pay workers according to the law. Examples of wage theft include paying less than minimum wage, not paying workers overtime, not allowing workers to take meal and rest breaks, requiring off-the-clock work, or taking workers' tips.""  While what this company is having PF associates do is 1000% BS, it isn't wage-theft.",jogj2zr
They fuck you in the job description by saying you may be asked to do things not listed here or something bs,joghvby
No.,jogzwpl
Wage theft is defined as not being paid the hours you physically work. Leadership can assign whatever tasks they feel you would be capable of. As an employee people need to adjust to multiple roles. You are still paid so no wage theft,joh4sz2
"it's not, these days, if you work for bestbuy, regardless of position, you're expected to do it all. its unorganized af, and continues to get worse",joh6lzt
"No, it‚Äôs not wage theft. I know it‚Äôs frustrating but you need to lookup what that actually means before making assumptions. If you work for anyone but yourself, you can be asked to do duties/tasks outside of your job code. It‚Äôs up to you to advocate for yourself, either ask for a raise for the additional work or look for another job. With all the snaps the company has done to save money, it‚Äôs not surprising that they‚Äôre adding additional workload on everyone left. PF/WH is overworked and understaffed but this was always the end goal. Sales coverage is always going to come first",johbqsn

"After 12 years as an Agent, my time has come.; After working for this company for 12 years, more than 11 of which was as a Car Audio Technician, I've been forced out. I was told to move to a store with a 45 minute commute compared to my 4 minute commute, and with absolutely zero incentives. ""You have two weeks left here, then you will move all your appointments to that store, and train two very green technicians. You are responsible for dragging a failing install bay out of the mud, and into success, like the bay you run now.""  ""Uh, no. I will not do that, I like having a short commute. But let's say I do agree, what are you offering me to do this? This is a LOT more work than I have now, and a much longer commute. Surely you plan to incentivise me somehow, right?""  ""No, you are at cap, we cannot offer you a raise. Ever, actually. The next time you are up for a raise, we will calculate how much money that would add to your annual pay, and give it to you in a lump sum. So, you will get nothing right now.""  ""Yeah, no. Like, HELL no. I am underpaid as it is. If you won't compensate me, and I have to commute anyway, then I will find someone who WILL compensate me. I'll have a new job in the next couole days, in fact. You do not realize how valuable I am. This is a really stupid move. Best Buy doesn't realize how lucky they are to have me as it is.""  ""Well, I can't stop you. We'd really like to have you at this other location, though, I think we could do great things there with you on board.""  ""Yup, seems like an amazing move... For Best Buy. But only if I was stipid enough to accept. I will have a new job before I work at that location. I will not work a single day there, just you watch.""  And so, within 12 hours, I had 9 offers from competitors. Most were out of state, but one was in the very town they wanted to send me to. That's where I work now. I never worked a single day in the bay they wanted me to go to, as promised. After 12 years of loyalty, this",14dxspe
"in the bay they wanted me to go to, as promised. After 12 years of loyalty, this was how Best Buy decided to show their appreciation. My managers at my location were and are fantastic. They are why I stayed so long... But whoever made this decision is an absolute idiot. In the end, I thank them, though. I'm making more money, I'm properly appreciated, and I will never have to deal with a BOSS order again, thank god. Time to show what I'm really capable of, without Best Buy acting as a shackle around my feet!",14dxspe

"Rae here. Super happy for you! Sad we won‚Äôt have you at our bay (for selfish reasons), but you definitely made the right decision. It‚Äôs because of your expertise and the little training I got from you that I‚Äôm trying to get this failing bay out of the mud, and I have hope that we‚Äôll someday succeed. But that won‚Äôt be because of BBY üòÖ Your new employer is SO lucky to have you!!",jose8zq

Really? That's a rare last name! I was at 1194.,josgo9h
"You and Caty have amazing potential, and I would have loved to train you both, if Best Buy had just given me *anything* to make that worthwhile. I feel terrible that you are on your own now, and even more terrible knowing that help and support from Best Buy is definitely not coming, considering I offered that over and over, only to be repaid like this. That bay is definitely failing, but let me be clear, that is *not* your fault. At all. That is 100% on the upper management of the company. You haven't been given the tools you need to even have a chance to truly succeed. If you do manage to pull that bay out of the mud, it will be completely your own doing, not because of the company.  My advice is, if you do manage to find success at Best Buy, leave the moment a good opportunity comes your way. Use that store to teach yourself new skills, and grow as an installer. Then, when you've started to really get a handle on things, jump ship. Best Buy will not hesitate to screw you over, if you are in the way, so don't stay out of a false sense of loyalty, like I did. Use Best Buy to get a step up in life, and don't get stuck. You deserve much better. ‚ù§Ô∏è",josg4eq

"Jbl 5.1 soundbar; Hello everyone does anyone know how to remove the demo mode out of the JBL 5.1 soundbar it was a vendor shelf display one. One of my managers decided to keep it for the HUB but is stuck on the demo mode. It does not let us control the volume, power off or do anything. I already tried power volume up key, power and source like it says on the internet but nothing is working. Any tips or suggestions would be helpful",14edki7
"1. It might have specific firmware on it that makes it ONLY function for demo purposes so a button combination may not work. Also it could only have the needed port actually function for the demo. The rest could be dead or disabled.   2. If there is a button combination it might be listed in VMM under the comments for that planogram or on IDIL for lvl 2 and lvl 3 support documents.   3. You could see if there's a firmware you can download from the vendors website that will essentially reset it to ""out of the box"" factory settings.   4. Make sure you put a DNI sticker on it or use the yellow stickers and write DNI on it so your swat staff don't count it as positive inventory.",joud47o

"Ramblings about employee discounts; a fake example.; For those who don't know, 99% of consumer sales in all types of markets are facilitated by the distributor/OEM(aka dell/apple/asus). Same for any department store: Costco, Microcenter, etc.  So when a laptop is $300 off MSRP, best buy isn't taking that price hit, the OEM is.  **With that said, consider this example.**  A $1200 asus laptop might give an employee discount of $150($1050 after).  However, If it goes on consumer-facing sale for $900, typically, you lose your employee discount.  Remember, however,¬†the OEM facilitated the sale. which is important, because BEST BUY is still making the same margin off of the new total of $900.   Basic math below:   \- $1200 MSRP with a best buy margin of 25% = **$240 gross profit**   \- $900 MSRP with best buy margin STILL at 25% = **$180 gross profit**  So, when sales happen, and we lose our discounts, which happens very often, it's hard not to be bitter at Best Buy. They seemingly strip an employee discount out of the picture while avoiding the PR hit.  Am I wrong here? This practice seems contrary to valuing employees. I was in distributor sales for quite some time and know how this stuff works for most types of markets (food, wine, cars, furniture).",14mdjt5

In other words there is a buy down price. This guarantee margin can also be given in high end sound bars or additional tv model or models at no cost. when this becomes impractical labor or advertising dollars can be issue by the OEM.

Shift leads; How's it working out for you so far?,14mdbfa
"It has been a mixed bag at our store.  One thing I like is it has helped out with coverage, which was my first concern with lay-offs. Shift leads can help open/close the building, which allows ""name-tag"" leaders to work during customer hours. I used to have to spend 4-5 hours hosting and engagement leading, whereas now I can spread that time amongst the shift leads and use that time to coach and train.  I also like that it is encouraging our employees to make decisions on ""basic"" MOD calls. So for example, does a supervisor or above really need to answer the ""Can I get an MOD to front lanes for a return question?"" When its for an opened product 3 days outside the return window. Like, y'all should know the policy, make a decision.   However, I do have concerns that the company has lowered the threshold to obtain keys and alarm codes.  There's also a lot of mixed messaging around shift lead expectations. I just got off a teams call where our marketplace AVP warned us to stop calling shift lead a position, and to refer to it as a task. ""Our shift leads are not supervisors."" And he's not wrong - it's not a job code. It's a task in TLC. But then he, our market HR, and my marketplace director (GM) turn around and list off all the things they want from our shift leads, and all of them sound very supervisory   This has caused tension amongst current shift leads. In the past, I was able to leverage the work I did as SWAT, for example, to get promoted. No one was paying me for the MOD calls I took as a non-leader. But now we are paying them for their shift lead work. And we're paying them like shit for it. So it's caused the issue where if we so much as ask ""hey can so and so shadow you today"" we get ""oh I'm not coded shift lead today so no.""  We don't want to abuse their help - like, yes they should get paid for leadership tasking - but it does bring up a lot of questions about personal brand and how you are supposed to carry yourself.  So, still some stuff to figure out as a store in terms of how we execute this",jq1vbzp
"For us, none of our 7 have gotten shift lead pay yet. I‚Äôm the only one refusing to do shift lead things unless I directly benefit(like if I need to do my own overrides or use keys etc)   They‚Äôre currently trying to get me to coach and train our new people while refusing to schedule any of us as shifts lead because ‚ÄúI‚Äôm unsure of how it works‚Äù   I‚Äôm also the only one that‚Äôs a part time employee, the rest are full time.",jq2e5ur
Meh...,jq30y9l
I wasü§èüèΩ close to accepting the shift lead position but when they told me it would be a 30¬¢ raise I immediately said no. Definitely not worth it for me lol,jq2d0ft
"Your AVP is absolutely wrong, tell him to look at the shift lead expectations that just came out. Its a two page document that has shift leads doing pages of supervisor duties to include interviewing seasonal job applicants. And it most definitely is a ""job code"". I've been a keyholder for over 3 years now as a part-time employee. Just hit 9 years of my second stint with bestbuy, my employee number is only 6 digits and my first hire date was 2004. In any event, I've only been a keyholder in my new store since October. Every month I was a keyholder in my previous store my POS access had to be reset from the lowest to highest so I could open/close registers and do overrides. Since they changed it to shift lead in the system my stuff does not reset like it used to, so in my experience it tells me that it's a job code.",jq3787m
I got my .37 right away. It's ridiculous,jq4lq67
"Well yes, that's part of the ""leveling up."" Right after he gave that warning, someone else presented a slide about the responsibilities shifting down.  But it's not a job you apply for. You can't put a job posting for ""shift lead"". It's just e-learning certifications that allow me to schedule someone in shift lead tasking.  It's a technicality that allows the company to avoid admitting  they expect everyone to do more work for less pay.    So you get things like my AVP and MD going ""we're not giving more work, just spreading out responsibilities"" but then my MD turns around and says ""Maybe we get to a point where shift leads are doing QCs, interviews, and writing schedules""",jq4mggv
My store gets a dollar but only when scheduled as shift lead. I‚Äôm still at minimum pay here,jq4rsxv
"Yeah, it's sounds like they're talking out of both sides of their mouth. But on the back end they had to do something with job codes and shift leads so that the systems (TLC, POS, etc) recognize the code and grant accesses.   It's just a joke where this company is at. The CEO has to be purposefully torpedoing this company because they can't be making these decisions for long term success and viability. It's a joke to cut the staff by 2/3, which is what they've done since the beginning of covid. And now they've gutted the leadership teams from the markets, districts and stores.",jq4o0yk
"You are wrong in the sense that Best Buy takes away our discount when the price drops just to be spiteful.  The reason that happens is if the new sale price is already less than our employee discount, then we automatically get whichever is lower.",jq4x4s9

Samsung's OLED tvs are QDOLED made by Samsung display. LG display makes standard WOLED panels.  Sony as of right now buys from both LG display and Samsung display. With the A80K and A90j/k being LG panels and the sony A95K and soon to be A95L using the Samsung QDOLED. A80k/A90j/k use the same panel as the LG C2 A95K is the same panel as S95B A95L will be the same panel as the S95C Lgs G3 OLED will feature similar brightness minus some color volume to the two but will be using their own unique MLA panel.  This is the only correct answer.  Edit: There might be a circumstance I could see where LG merely supplied Samsung with the OLED tech but Samsung still has to turn that OLED into a QDOLED since if you go more in depth they're the same type just structured differently with coatings and subpixels and quantum dots and blah blah blah now we are into a different subject entirely.,jqck47z
"I haven‚Äôt really considered that this wasn‚Äôt a QD-OLED because Samsung states it is and there is no reason to mislead consumers as it could only lead to false advertisement claims.

I'm no expert but LG has the G3 which uses MLA which is LG answer to Sony and Samsungs QD-OLED because the didn't invest into QD OLED. MLA does get the G3 really bright tho which is why it's in the comparison with the S95C and A95L  LG G3 is not a QD-OLED LG does not make one.   Side note Samsung does not consider the S95C as their flagship tv either so many experts believe it's full capabilities are being held back  S95C is too expensive imo I'd go for the G3 but damn the S95B is probably best price to performance tv we've seen in a while. The No Dolby vision for the S95 is a turnoff but a lot of reviewers say the difference is a non factor for most  Editing cuz I release you also asked about panels MLA are LG panels   QD-OLED are Samsungs own panels,jqck6qn
"From everything I've seen and read, this is a true quantum dot OLED manufactured by Samsung Display. LG has nothing to do with this tech as Samsung Display is using a different subpixel layout for their screens compared to what LG has produced.   As to Sony, I believe they procure most of their OLED panels from LG, but I believe their QD panel is from Samsung. This I'm far less certain on, as I don't keep up with the stories around Sony.  But as far as the S95C is concerned, it is a Samsung Display and a true QD-OLED. I also think Samsung has a superior offering: in addition to the better display tech because of QD-OLED, I strongly dislike any display that has a hardwired power cord. Why LG does this with most of their OLED TVs is beyond me. That Samsung has not just a detachable power cord, but also a One Connect box, puts them way in front of what LG is offering.",jqclh8c
"Long answer here...  Samsung Display and LG Display make OLED panels. They are separate from Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics. Think of them more like sister companies.   LG Display makes WOLED (also called WRGB, the emphasis is on the W meaning a white subpixel is added). Up until last year, that was the only panel available, and Sony (and others) used LGs panel in their OLEDs.   LG Display's goal is to sell as many panels as possible, so they actually loved Sony and others buying their panels. When Sony started winning the King of TV Shootout over LG, they didn't care because it was still Display's panel. Of course LG Electronics wasn't happy about it üòú.  Samsung Electronics firmly supports QLED as the premier tech and NOT OLED (even the QD variety). They have been very vocal in their anti-OLED stance. But they are affected by changes to their sister company Samsung Display.  Samsung Display used to make only LED panels. But LED panel production has slowly been shifting to China as Chinese companies can make them much cheaper. No one wants to buy a Chinese tv, but no one realizes where the panel in their tv comes from, so manufacturers are going to go with the cheapest panel available that performs to the required specs.   That means Samsung Display knew they had to get out of the LED panel business. Enter QD-OLED. They shifted to producing QD-OLED panels last year with really poor results to start. When they first were producing them, they had about a 30% yield (only 3 out of 10 panels survived the process). However, by the end of the year that number flipped to like 75% which was an incredible turnaround.   Sony saw the potential in QD-OLED and bought in almost immediately, which is very unlike Sony, who usually does not buy in on brand new technology. Samsung Electronics still wanted no part in OLEDs though, so they would not make a QD-OLED at first. Speculation here, but the thought is eventually the Samsung parent company stepped in and forced SSE to buy the panels from SSD or else SSD would have had difficulty not going under.   While the QD panels were being developed, LG was working on the MLA panel. Completely different technology, but one that can get brightness equivalent to that of QD (although colors still aren't at the WD level).  For this",jqdngh8
"that of QD (although colors still aren't at the WD level).  For this year, the end result is LG will use LG Display's WOLED and MLA panels for their lineup. The 55, 65, and 77 G3 will use MLA, everything else will use the traditional WOLED panel (of which there are a couple of variations). This includes the 83"" G3 which will not be MLA (MLA panel not available in that size yet).  Sony will use the LG's WOLED in the A80L (all sizes), and Samsung's QD-OLED in the A95L.  Samsung will use their QD-OLED panels in their S90C and S95C. They are also probably going to have a WOLED model later this year with an LG Display panel.   Quick explanation of panels... OLED is inherently a dimmer technology, so it's all about getting the best color while maintaining brightness. Very simple explanation here, but WOLED uses a white subpixel, then filters it to make Red/Green/Blue light. This filtering process removes energy/brightness from the light, so white light is then reintroduced to brighten the image.   MLA uses tiny lenses to amplify the light and make it brighter, leading to a brighter picture and potentially less white light needed to brighten the picture.   QD-OLED uses quantum dots, which rather than filter light actually transforms light to the color of the crystal used. The panel started with blue light (the strongest wavelength of R/G/B) and then either passes the blue light straight through or hits the Red or Green quantum crystal. The energy from the blue light activates the crystal which gives off its corresponding color. You get bright colors without introducing white.   WOLEDs look great, but there is a slight whitewashing of colors (particularly reds). If that's all you've ever seen you would never even realize it. A QD-OLED makes much more vivid reds and can even produce shades or reds that have never been displayed on a tv before. When you watch demos on the A95 or S90/95, pay attention to the reds.   Theoretically the MLA should be able to do better colors too since the lenses allow less reliance on white light additions, but I've compared C3s to G3s and I honestly just don't see it.",jqdngh8
Watchs videos from stop the fomo on YouTube.   I believe you can tell if you look at it under a magnifier device and see the difference between a woled (lg oled with white subpixel)   rumors are s90c is woled this year and the s95c is newer gen qdoled. Can say after installing them both the s95c looks brighter for sure,jqcipwj

"how to get more comfortable at best buy??; i‚Äôve been at best buy for a month now and the training process is‚Ä¶ not really a process. I did the elearnings and they toss me from person to person to shadow. but nobody thoroughly and properly trained me on the register or taught me about the products we sell.   i don‚Äôt know if this is normal or not but i struggle to do my job without help from another coworker and without learning about, what i feel like, is essential information. I can‚Äôt help customers properly or do smooth exchanges or bby card lookups and it‚Äôs been a month.   How can i work better and more independently with the limited training i‚Äôve been given?  what should i be studying? what should I know in order to be a better sales associate ??

Get comfortable with just that.  I used to love the company but when I was told I couldn't coach and train as a supervisor it was rough.,jqqajnp
In all honesty in order to learn a little more about products I would watch tech review videos and I would also ask coworkers that have more knowledge about the products (especially if it‚Äôs a hobby of theirs) to tell me about them. I‚Äôm in the field now and whenever a customer asks me a question I can‚Äôt answer I go to the people in the store that I know would have the answer and ask them. Also reading specs and reviews on our website about certain products can give you a heads up as to what potential buyers may encounter as problems if they purchase and good points of the product.,jqqqzxp
"Best Buy, like a lot of other jobs unfortunately, doesn‚Äôt really have product training in their curriculum, it‚Äôs kind of something that comes from working there and trying to work with customers. I‚Äôm not sure if you have a designated area or not, but what I did when I started in home theater was looking up all the display TVs, soundbars, etc and learning what I can from there with the Best Buy app and the info tabs. Google is also your best friend. You‚Äôll start to learn through customer interactions what info is important and what isn‚Äôt. The best sales associates always help the customer find the best product for their wants and needs.   I always use customer interactions to learn wherever I can too, if they ask a question I don‚Äôt know, I either say ‚Äúthat‚Äôs a great question let me look into that for you‚Äù or if it‚Äôs really out of my reach, try and find somebody who would know. If the latter is the case, I always make sure to watch the other associate help the customer to try to learn there too.",jqqz3e8

Severance questions; I called Best Buy HR to get clarification but they were not help. So I was reading over the severance agreement and it says that if I‚Äôm rehired by Best Buy or by a third party company that provides services to Best Buy I might have to pay back some of the severance pay.  Does anyone know if the severance pay starts right after I got laid off? Or from when the severance packet gets signed and processed? For example if I‚Äôm getting 10 weeks is it 10 weeks from the day I get the severance pay or from June 17th ( day after my termination day) ?,14tji8u

"Soda stream provides a box to store the empties in, I think it holds like 15 or 18. They are pre labeled all that needs to happen is to seal the box, ensure the label is visible and send it out with UPS.  As for processing the return at customer service, you have to do it through the trade-in administration tool. Wrap the empty container with the travel tag that prints and put it in said box.   Someone mentioned that there is an SOP, just search for soda stream trade in to get the most up to date info.",jsf816n
"There's a full guide within the warehouse section of SOP for processing soda stream canisters. From the moment an exchange is requested, to how to process them in trade in administration and how to ship them back out through UPS. The box they arrive in is the same box you ship them in. The problem is that people destroy the box lose the canisters or deface the outbound labels for shipping it out.   Problems arise from people just putting them in the recycling area, Gaylord, hazardous waste bins in the warehouse or trying to PRC them.   Like I said.... lack of training or willingness to learn.  If people buy them outright they pay full price, if they do an exchange they get them for half price I think or a % off of a new one.   When leaders don't help or know...pull up SOP or elearnings and look for the topic at hand.",jsesad5
"Restructuring to Micromarket; The micromarket Company restructure was piloted for about 2 years in NY and essentially became the company  gold standard... The idea is simply put as so - the micromarket would work like one big store (how SWAS was before) however resources are deployable from the Hub store (hence why Hub stores have the most headcount and generally the best of the best)... If a micromarket has 3 stores, picture those 3 stores as 1 big store - that's the idea behind the cuts and deployable labor from the hub store - in so many words, it's like a ""loyalty 1"" but to another store vs another department... From this perspective, you don't need 3 GSMs but 1 Services experience manager (the best GSM supposedly) to run this ""big store"" or MM and the other 2 GSMs would get cut... Evaluations were made based on personal ranking submitted to GM, GM rankings of leaders submitted to MM director (also the hub store GM but not really - they are like a DM of their MM but do have the Hub store as their home location) and then ""in partnership"" with AVP (Marketplace manager, more to come) and HR and 3rd party company (DEI/ESG) - decisions were made on who would stay and who would leave... How those decisions were made were never explained to the individuals getting severance so that was essentially a mystery except to the parties involved in the decision making... Many stores were left in complete shock at who was retained and how the leaders were let go (basically, the leaders were scheduled to work and during their shift, they were given the scripted speech with their severance information, hopes of roles popping open soon in JOS, and being walk out the building without telling anyone what just happened and not being able to say bye to their teams). The main concern with the scheduled sit down severance speeches were to ensure that ""GMs got the store keys back to prevent having to rekey the buildings"" - as far as how the leader felt or having an opportunity to speak to anyone, that was placed at 0% priority or concern.  The Micromarket restructuring started about a year ago and I may have missed a few areas however, in general, this is pretty accurate.   Corporate: many mergers and cuts occurred there as well, I don't have too many details as that was outside of my wheelhouse however, it was very impactful",153ukht
"have too many details as that was outside of my wheelhouse however, it was very impactful when I was informed.  Territory, Market, District: essentially all of those leaders and their staff were absorbed into a ""Marketplace"". A marketplace is like 3-4 districts from a legacy perspective (which was like 2 markets to go a little further) and managed by an AVP (assistant Vice President)... So obviously, there were a lot of cuts from the territory, market and district levels (many of those leaders saw the writing on the wall and left beforehand)... Many went the corporate route or multichannel/unit route or home services route (as remote work was and still is overemphasized and overresourced however, still pretty safe in comparison to employees inside 4 walls) and then the rest were simply laid off... Many hundreds of years of tenure gone down the drain.  Field Agents: Essentially cut in half, this happened like a week ago around independence day.  Precinct: GSMs cut (there is one Services Experience manager per micromarket now in store and some stores have a services supervisor but not all).   Sales: all ASMs cut in half (with the exception of one Hub store per micromarket which may have 2-3 ASM - experience managers as they are called now, will be responsible and accountable for both Sales and Ops and will have a few weeks to learn the ropes). All SSMs cut whether appliances, connected, mobile, etc - they generally got absorbed into the Sup staffing headcount... Sups cut down to 2 or 3 maximum per store with 1 possibly being services supervisor for GSP (again, not every store had this Staffing Headcount - some stores got rid of GSM and the Senior is running the show in partnership with MM services experience manager). From sales, it's safe to say that at least 50% of the leaders were laid off (if you go from the furlough days of pandemic - you can say that 50% advisors have been cut since then as well although, this was not part of the micromarket op model) and what was replaced was a bucket of 40 hours per week per store of labor in leadership bucket for shift leads... If a store has 6 shift leads for example, each will get ""up to"" 7 hours of Shift lead pay per week - some more than others depending on how many managerial tasks/duties they are assigned... Shift leads",153ukht
"some more than others depending on how many managerial tasks/duties they are assigned... Shift leads are essentially supposed to be your ""cream of the crop"" talent (although many stores were amateurishly handing out the position like candy on Halloween - how we used to do with backup VPLs in the past - and now are battling an uphill battle with the selections they made)... The way it should work is that SL get scheduled that labor ""activity"" (as it is not a Job Code per se but more of a skillset you schedule like you would a ""monthly training"" or ""new hire"") after being certified via elearnings and leadership approval in Learning Network... Those SLs should have been the best hourly line level employees and essentially were runner-up for Sup roles or what have you... The problem that is occurring in store now is that, there is a nudge coming from leadership that basically states the following ""a SL performs managerial duties when scheduled; a good SL performs managerial duties when needed; a great SL performs managerial duties at all times"" - the conflict arises when these SLs forget that they still have to contribute to store Performance and Look and Feel causing a ""power trip"" effect and fellow advisors getting upset at their high horse syndrome... Some more intelligent veteran SLs say, ""I will only perform key calls, overrides, MOD resolutions, etc while I'm being paid as SL"" because they are aware that there would be no promotional opportunity any time soon... This will by far be the greatest hurdle for the company as many of these veteran advisors working as SLs are not ""drinking the juice"" and feel that the company cut a plethora of leaders yet the job still remains to complete - end result, the SL must perform and/or verify the task completion for lesser pay than previous Sups and without the name tag title to go along with... Obviously, this causes conflicts among advisors who are not SLs as jealousy or envy or even misunderstanding of the SL role causes internal discomfort and conflicts.  Product flow: essentially now a team which are led by shift leads (on a daily basis however, the EM for each store in partnership with GM and MM director could make a Sup in charge of Ops but not company directive). The traditional daily tasks, Merch, plano, Swat, Truck, etc are all merged into a bucket of labor now - there isn't a direct leader in the warehouse per se",153ukht
"merged into a bucket of labor now - there isn't a direct leader in the warehouse per se simply some SLs unless a MM decides to use a Sup for Ops (highly unlikely yet, some do have a process or Specialty Coach that may be utilized for ""setting direction"" in the MM)... As in the sales floor dilemmas, PF probably has much more as things like Truck night are being led by an able bodied advisor yet, they may back off the actual physical labor and ""manage"" the truck team the whole night... The ""too many chiefs, not enough Indians"" conflict arises (just as it does on the Sales floor) and many of the SLs have slim to no experience in actual people leading to diffuse the conflicts and create reasonable solutions... Again, the greatest issue will be getting the SL program under control as many may confuse the job activity with the job title and feel empowered to believe they are no longer required to roll their sleeves up and work.  Outcome - apparently, NY micromarket stated that it took quite some time to get it figured out but that they love it now... I can say this was said to me by a few GMs when I was doing training with them (they kept winning on many of the scorecards at the time and it sparked my curiosity)... Turnover is expected of course and as cold as that may seem, it's actually calculated and even taken into account with salary compensation for those employees moving forward.  Many are not in favor and feel that these changes and restructurings are occurring so quickly that uncertainty and employee morale are at an all time low... These changes including the changes that occurred with Total Tech (TTS, TT, MBBYTotal, etc) are all signs of amateur leadership from the top or signs of potential financial distress - definitely not well organized or thorough... That would probably be the most accurate assumption today and most employees would leave the company given the opportunity to as they feel the company no longer has its original core values and employee experience at heart... Some feel empowered and some have enthusiasm as they feel that many of the tenured leaders leaving will open up doors for their careers... Who's right? Only time will tell.",153ukht

"Sometimes I wonder how little thought gets put into what‚Äôs expected of us; Today we were approached by our manager going over the new behaviors they‚Äôre expecting us to do while interacting with customers. The big thing that stood out was weird was that we‚Äôre now expected to ask every customer for their phone number up front and put it into solution sidekick on our phones. My first thought from the customers perspective is they don‚Äôt know what solution sidekick is so it‚Äôs gonna come off as kinda creepy and intrusive that right from the get go a stranger is asking for their phone number they then are going to put in their own phone. I get that solution sidekick is a good tool for customers with complex orders/needs, but if I‚Äôm a grab and go customer and I get hounded for my phone number at the top of every interaction I go into a store, I‚Äôm gonna stop going to that store. Be Human, don‚Äôt be creepy.",15427rb
Super creepy. You should ask your manager to demonstrate this on a few customers so you can see how it‚Äôs done. And then watch him or her crash and burn.,jsmekz6

"If memberships weren't incentivised for managers, you'd never hear about them; We're making these assholes' bonuses",1580byk
They make like $40k+/year from bonuses. Basically the equivalent to 1-2 full timers‚Äô salary. Think about that the next time your store is short staffed,jt7pqbc
"Fun fact, there was a time when employees were given bonuses for hitting store budget and good NPS. That was taken away and just managers get bonuses now. (I have very transparent managers that confirm they still get bonus based off metrics).",jt7x1cc
Look guys. I got kick to the curb in the last round  I was a manager   credit app and total tech is not how managers  Bonus... yes it does hit the bottom  line on the P&L  BUT  selling more TV and appliances do that also.   Getting memberships only helps with the store manager keeping his job.   Getting credit app means the customer MAY come back to make another purchase. Total tech is easy money in the bank only 10 percent will use it and best buy banks the money,jt7qpn8
"Or they're just doing their job? You can view management pay and bonus structure any time you want in Connect. You will find no incentive for leaders to push memberships lol. And also, last years bonus was a joke and this years is probably on pace to also be a joke.",jt7pshk

"Membership Stealing or Tough Luck?; Scenario:  Verizon VPL helping out in Computers due to traffic.

While the customers are in the restroom you help solve the problem in mobile.

"I‚Äôd like to clear up how bonuses work for you guys.  Source: former SSM under the bonus structure l. I‚Äôm an inhome agent now.  Best Buy manager bonuses has three components - Revenue, Operating Income, and Shared Success. They used to all be weighted a third but I believe it‚Äôs like 40/40/20 now.  Memberships are profitable and help with OI, but there is no bonuses for hitting membership goals. Bad leaders don‚Äôt explain the WHY of membership.  The strategy is that with the card it gives them more buying power to get all the services and accessories (Rev and OI) and with Plus and Total is incentivized repeat business. (Which is why you should be hearing about relational customers vs transactional customers in your coaching)  But there has never been a bonus for memberships but memberships are the leading indicator of hitting Rev and OI.  Shared success is a mystery metric though. It‚Äôs basically the part of your bonus that when the big bosses get to bonus, you get some too. It‚Äôs not a super controllable metric at the store level.",jt8x1i8
It was like that over 20 years ago when I worked for the company,jt90zp3
"I remember those days, I also remember the starting wage was 9/hr and average bonus payouts were well under $100,  after taxes. And this was only IF the store qualified. The bonus that we ""might"" get was traded for a permanent bump on base pay to $15/hr. This trade was made at the employees' request through a benefits survey that was conducted.    Even now the bonus leaders get isn't guaranteed, it relies on store and company performance. While membership performance is a factor, it's not the only one, it's not even the biggest factor.  It's no secret, if you really want to learn more about the STI policy it's available for free on Connect I believe.",jt93vbe

So effing sick of management with daily check in; Every fucking day as u clock in they look at ur numbers telling you what you should work on like how many bps or membership or revenue u can get for the day try to get triple green as if they wouldnt replace you regardless as we‚Äôve seen with the firing of achievers and others who have done well. I am absolutely fed up when im mentally stressed by the constant stupidity of everything and being told to get something that i have no power over as if they think i dont pitch it plus the shadowing of managers are even more infuriating‚Ä¶i am praying someone calls me for an interview as i keep throwing my resume to anywhere but best buy,158xm55
100% agree with you.  These daily check-ins do nothing but put more stress on employees. Something that always baffled me about these as well is management will tell you to not see a customer as another number (ex. not see a customer as membership #5 etc.) yet that‚Äôs exactly what these check-ins do lmao.,jtchvif
Right... Let's make 3 people do the work of 9 and have a manager follow you around telling you what you could have done better.

The amount of chatter about apps on the radio the whole day is mind numbing and depressing.  Shopping in other best buys as a customer sometimes where I'm unknown, it's clearly a company issue.

How are you guys pitching the new my best buy plus and total?; I‚Äôm having a hard time explaining the differences between the 2,159fm06
"I start with the plus. First looking to see if whatever they‚Äôre buying or considering to buy offers member deals. I call it a 60 day price match policy and explain we run sales every week and chances are the item they‚Äôre buying might go on sale within the two months. Also show member deals on my phone that they will get if they become a member and how it‚Äôs update almost daily. I bring up total if we start talking about protection or services to be done.   By the way this is all done while talking to them about products and brought up early. Don‚Äôt mention price of the membership unless they ask. You‚Äôll find your own way to pitch it but once you get it down, it‚Äôs not that hard. I‚Äôm pushing Plus way more than total. When you pitch both of them at the same time, customers get lost and stop caring.",jtexe2s
"The two biggest differences between the two are the free in store services and the included protection plan. Asking questions like ‚Äúdo you shop here a lot?‚Äù And ‚Äúdo you usually buy warranties on your devices?‚Äù is a great way to break the ice on getting into the membership conversation. Me personally I like to find a specific item they‚Äôre looking for before getting into any of that talk and I‚Äôll give you a example. Greet customer , pull up their account. ‚ÄúHey David I see you‚Äôre not a cardholder or member with us , just to let you know all of our laptops currently are 0% interest for 12 months if you wanted to take advantage of that, we also do have some great membership benefits but I‚Äôll get into that a little more later‚Äù. You find laptop they want. ‚ÄúGreat choice, I do have a couple more questions, do you plan on buying a protection plan for this laptop?‚Äù Are you going to be needing a data transfer from your old device to this new one?‚Äù If they answer yes to those you should SHOW them the $179 membership, we are visual beings, SHOW them the savings , ‚ÄúI did briefly mention about membership benefits and I do believe our $179 membership is going to be fantastic for you, along with included protection up to 2 years on this device and majority of other items you buy all of our in store services are free meaning we can transfer your data to your new device for free, how does that sound?‚Äù  If they yes great! Briefly go over the extra benefits like 60 day return policy and member pricing . If they aren‚Äôt interested that‚Äôs where you ask them if they shop here a lot, and SHOW them our member deals in the app or ssk(when it works ha ha). If they seem interested that‚Äôs where you mention the $49.99 membership . In general if I can find a laptop/tv on a membership price that fits the specs and needs of the customer I tend to bring them to that specific sku first because if they aren‚Äôt interested in total it‚Äôs much easier to transition into plus because most of the time that member price pays for the membership on the initial purchase.",jtf1u6q

"Getting cucked; I‚Äôve been with Best Buy since November of last year, and before the snap I got bumped to shift lead with the promises of great things to come(like everyone else) mainly me being full time, but that never happened. It kept on going to other people of our ‚Äúregional manager‚Äù said we couldn‚Äôt have anymore full time. So I was the only non-full time shift lead. I got my codes and my keys and it made my life easier. But I noticed every other shift lead was getting their hands held and helped along the way, allowed to go do manager things and just be treated better. But for me, when I said I‚Äôd go do an override, or try to take care of a angry customer I got told no, I‚Äôve gotten zero support on the floor. Plus I kept getting yelled at by our ASM to ‚Äúdo better or something going to change.‚Äù Before my ‚Äúpromotion‚Äù he never talked to me like that, i used to average 25 bps and 20 Tt‚Äôs a month, but since the change I‚Äôm at 10 and 8 currently.

When I got told I didn‚Äôt get the jobs I was always told ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry, we will work you like your full time‚Äù) hours a week to 21. I can‚Äôt live like that at $15 a hour.

I am inclined to think that if they weren't letting you do duties like letting you do overrides,  or whatever.. there was probably a reason.

I would ask what can you improve on, take the criticism honestly and if you think it's BS, move on from the company.

"HOT TAKE: Middle Eastern Customers; Before I get started this is not a rant on anyone's race or ethnicity.  This is about something that I've recognized over and over again throughout my years of retail, mostly at Best Buy.     We already know that Middle Eastern customers always ask for a ""DISCOUNNNNNNNT"" but the one thing I can't stand about them is their indecisiveness.  They come in all the time in the last few minutes before the store closes, setup orders for items then as soon as the transaction is processed they change their mind and want to buy something different.  It's ALWAYS a Middle Eastern customer that changes their mind at the very last second, then has to debate which one to get with one of the 7 family members they go into the store with.     I can't be the ONLY one who has noticed this with them.",15i9vl8

"Lack of retention; So I‚Äôve been working for Best Buy for a couple months now. I don‚Äôt mean to sound like a showboat, but this will help my overall point: I was the top salesman last month and am on track to do even better numbers this month, all in my first three months.  Im an occasional/seasonal employee, and yet my employer is giving me full time hours. Im hitting overtime this week and next week, and by no means am I complaining. But something I‚Äôve noticed is that they‚Äôre cutting hours on employees that have been here for years. A full time employee is receiving 25-30 hours to cut labor hours and im receiving 38+ each week.  While I understand that this is a ‚Äúperformance based position,‚Äù my colleagues have seemingly bashed me for undermining their hours when all im doing is my job. In my first three months, I‚Äôve seen full timers leave because of labor cuts, not just on the sales floor, but product flow just as much.  Best Buy really needs to work on incentivizing with their employees better.  At this rate, I‚Äôd have much better pay at an actual commission based job and probably be appreciated more.  I feel like I‚Äôm just a number to the GM and the AGM at this point. Does anyone else feel this way?",15ix5ck

But yes, with the tech evolving as quick as it has lately an AI trained on Best Buy policy with hooks into our ordering system/inventory/customer profiles could conceivably replace even the overseas agents (which honestly would probably be an improvement). For example, AI wouldn‚Äôt fear disappointing the caller and saying things that are wrong just to get the call over faster.  But we‚Äôre at a major inflection point similar to when the first machines took over jobs that used to be done by hand 100-150 years ago. The big question is will society be able to adapt or will it lead to violence/sabotage as it did in some instances in the past?

"He was excellent for the company and made brilliant choices BUT... There's not a CEO alive that gives 2 crap cakes about the employee. CEO'S only care about profits, how to get profits, keeping shareholders happy because the more profits they make the more money they take home. I'm sure everyone has seen the article that CB took a pay cut ummmm no, profits are down so your percentage of stock shares are down. Never make the mistake of believing that the company cares, they care that you think they care but it's a business turning on a dime crushing the people that actually bleed for the company is commonplace.

"I would go with LG, and here's why. I was a Home Theater Agent that did repairs on TVs. The number one TV I hated going out to fix was Sony. Especially if we had to deal with the factory warranty and put up with their bullshit. We would do a triage, and that wouldn't fix the TV all the time. Then, they would send part after part  until it was past 30 days or if the cost was BER (Beyond Economical Repair) on their end. Before I left, a poor elderly client was still waiting to get his Sony tv replaced after almost 3 months of multiple agents trying to fix it, but Sony wouldn't replace it. Sony's are great when they work, but after having to deal with them for 5 years on repairs and the headaches they have given us and clients. I refuse to buy a Sony TV. I would rather buy myself an LG OLED any day. It is much easier to deal with and easy to fix. I also didn't have to repair a lot of them. Samsung, I did repair the most, but those repairs are not a problem at all. They were the easiest to repair, but like I said, they do get serviced a lot. If you're going to get a Sony, then get the GSP plan. The process through the Geek Squad was simpler than the factory warranty but still a pain in the ass to fix. Sorry for the paragraph. I can say a lot more, but I bet no one is reading this far.  TL:DR - Sony is a pain in the ass to deal with for this repair agent.",jw3qxul
Sony overall but LG for OLED.,jw3u13q
"For me, TVs are great and all, but i can‚Äôt see myself over paying for something I‚Äôd want to fill my entire house with.  The best bang for the buck for me is Vizio‚Äôs M and P line. For the price of a large enough LG that has the features I want, I can get a 75 inch P, and 2 or 3 M‚Äôs.  The reliability is pretty good too. The one in my office I‚Äôve had for 6 or 7 years, and it‚Äôs only just now starting to give me so local dimming issues on the top right corner. Considering I spent I think $500 for it, I got my moneys worth with it.  It‚Äôs worth noting though that everyone‚Äôs priorities are different. I‚Äôll get a Vizio P series TV, but I‚Äôm got two Apple Studio displays on my desk.",jw3vawq
Anyone have a Sony OLED and can give me some insight on it? I‚Äôve been looking at them but I‚Äôve heard stuff about their brightness not being that great,jw3oq8j
"Sony is great but they have their own rare issues. Lg makes a great OLED and some nice LEDs but I think Samsung and Sony fair better on the LED side of things. Even their flagship the qned85 is nice, I think most of our customers would be quite happy with the picture quality. But Samsung and Sony LED's are just more impressive to me. Even if you set all 3 to their respective filmmaker mode. Samsung has a lot of brand loyalty in my area and we do capitalize. Hell I got Samsung's. I've heard they have more failure's and seeing how many people complain is kinda how we would know about a failure rate. But I've also seen LG and Sony have failures pretty bad. If asked I'll tell them that, probably has a higher failure rate, but I don't think the risk differential is all that great. Definitely a compromise tv for me. But a pretty damn good one on the high end. But this year even their low end it pretty good. I think the cu7000 is actually a little impressive in the shadows and a decent brightness for a crystal uhd. Likewise from the x77l from Sony.  Lg uq series tv's look bland by comparison on the low end and their qned ain't quite as nice on the high end. Tcl and hisense came out swinging with the qm8 and u8 tv's but my store doesn't have those to display. Only the cheaper ones. Which still provide a good value for what they are but I know they would sell like crazy if people could see them. Stick mostly to Sony and Samsung   Also I'm constantly triggered by tizen",jw3vqfx
"All of them have their ups and downs. LG can‚Äôt get certain apps, Sony‚Äôs software makes a good amount of non-Sony sound bars just not work, Samsung puts out a bunch of gimmick TVs that just aren‚Äôt worth the lower quality and higher price, etc.  Personally, I‚Äôm in the LG camp. WebOS is easy enough to deal with and a fire stick can solve the missing apps issue. The OLEDs are worth it.",jw3ykfi
"I love my LG C2, it's a 55"" and works well with my PS5.",jw455oj
"I personally have a preference for LG, however having a go to brand is flawed sales tactics.  It gives off strong used car salesmen vibes. Or worse, ‚ÄúI get incentives on this brand so buy this one‚Äù. A little research and you‚Äôll find it entirely depends on the customers wants and ‚Äúneeds‚Äù. While Samsung makes the best brightroom TV, Hisense makes a wonderful midrange contender. LG dominates on the OLED side but not every category because LG has a wildly varying range of good, better, and best both Samsung and Sony have good contenders. Samsung has more service calls because they almost out sale at a 2 to 1 ratio over all the other brands. But if you look at percentages they are all pretty close to each other in terms of sales to service.  And if the customer is that concerned about needing a service call or wants more comprehensive coverage that‚Äôs literally why Best Buy has the gold standard in warranty. Especially right now, because of such an aging market more often that not the older models have a better price to quality ratio that makes it hard to get a 2023 version of TV.",jw4q4lz

So? You act like that‚Äôs a big deal when it‚Äôs really not. They are still rather different performing top end TVs with their own strengths and weaknesses.

Vizio is not the company they used to be. I do NOT recommend Vizio anymore at all costs. These days you‚Äôre rolling dice if you get a good panel and Vizio doesn‚Äôt care about their tvs as much as how much money they can make by selling your advertising profile as you use their smartOS.,jw4lw4d
"Not quite a Sony OLED owner but I see you asked twice and I feel I have some insight. I got an S95B demo for a scorching deal. But I've spent a lot of time with the Sony's. They are probably the least bright OLED right now. But I'd say they are suitable for any room where blinds can be drawn. Ideal for darker spaces.  Sony prioritized accuracy of intent more in their image processing resulting in a sometimes less saturated and cool image than their competition, especially in a more vivid picture mode. You do still get reflections though, being able to see light fixtures and stuff . But you can't get rid of that without a matte display.  And that would suck for the contrast. Some of the competition is brighter or has better anti glare. But Sony is pretty good in both departments and is awesome in its own regard. Just compared based on preference, price and picture in person and features",jw3xbch

Do you think Samsung has the most repairs cause they sell more tvs than other brands. So percentage wise they have the same issues as smaller brands but seams like more due to volume?,jw4kcka
"I know, that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt use their SmartTV anything. I give it monthly access to Ethernet for firmware updates but other than that it‚Äôs disconnected and I use an Apple TV. You can also disable the profile in settings. Thats what I did with my latest 75 inch and haven‚Äôt had a problem.",jw4m4i0
"Why would I make a counter argument to the Sony being the better choice? I own 2 Sony oleds (currently a total of 8 Sony TVs in my house lol)  I didn‚Äôt say they are equally performing, in fact I said they are rather different.  All the panel does is turn on and off and set a possible color gamut.  Everything else about the TV determines how it actually performs. I was just stating that using an LG panel is not impactful in the way you were trying to state.",jw5i93z
"Okay... Let me try this again.   Everyone in the topic, including you, keep recommending Sony. You say they perform ""differently."" So are you going to explain HOW, or just tell me I'm wrong in the vaguest way possible? I've seen more than a few employees become rabid fanboys for brands out of love for their demo/revenue potential, not value for money (coughSonoscoughcough) ; I'm trying to figure out if that's it or there's a genuine quality difference I'm somehow missing.  I've side by sided both brands across several years, and generally prefer the LG. That experience has been borne out in objective testing from various reviews.

Leaders; I was watching ‚Äúdeath of a game: halo infinite‚Äù by nerdslayer studios and he was talking about the leadership with Microsoft and 343 during the development time for the game and honestly it really applies to the Best Buy I work at and seemingly at other stores that I‚Äôve seen across this subreddit. The leaders at Best Buy don‚Äôt really lead. They see the title and just bark orders or come over to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù. Most don‚Äôt deescalate issues with customers and they don‚Äôt know how or they seemingly don‚Äôt escalate order issues. They never tell new hires or advisors information about the store or company until it‚Äôs last minute and by then it‚Äôs too late. They will also tell new hires the wrong information. Our new Assistant GM told a new hire we don‚Äôt use SKUs for our Apple products when product flow and all advisers on the floor do use SKUs when looking for Apple products. This is my first corporate sales job and it seems like it‚Äôs a complete mess and it‚Äôs a free for all with the leaders on how they should order people around and belittle their advisers when they get the chance. The customers where I work aren‚Äôt too bad but I see what everyone on this subreddit means in that Best Buy is a sinking ship. It‚Äôs a total mess and the higher ups definitely don‚Äôt care about the advisers who do all the selling. I feel like for this company to want people to work here they need to restructure their philosophy on how they treat employees.,15r2u1w

"In the old days the ARA job was a good way to be able to mostly hide from customers and the job description reflected as such (not in so plain terms). But as the company has evolved into a more lean operating model, (that doesn't match customer demand), stores have had to be creative in trying to bring the best experience to the customer.  The new job descriptions for most store positions have been updated to reflect this new mindset. For example here are a few excerpts from the current  Job Description:  The Geek Squad Advanced Repair Agent identifies and offers technology related, solution-based recommendations to solve customer needs and ensure that no customer is left unserved.   They create and maintain a supportive environment for customers by asking the right questions, listening carefully, taking detailed notes and partnering with other team members.   They are passionate about technology and leverage their technical abilities to create positive customer interactions by solving a variety of software and hardware issues.  At Best Buy, we are obsessed with building long term relationships with our customers. Every team member should feel empowered to deliver a world-class and unique experience based on what each customer needs.  Key Responsibilities - Helps drive a positive customer experience by building relationships, exhibiting empathy, and providing solutions for their needs.  I mean it should not be any surprise by now that stores are doing whatever is necessary to try to meet the customer expectations.   Do I agree?  Of course not!  I think the forecasters and labor teams have severely miscalculated the post-covid retail landscape, and lost sight of what made Best Buy great. That formula was simple, train great employees, promot a genuine customer experience and REAL having fun while being the best. That best buy is still there, just being suffocated.  Take my word with a grain of salt, because I've been out of the store since April, but until then I had high enough visibility to see all of this coming and most of my predictions have come to pass up until then. I have faith in all of the store teams and store leaders alike, if the company tanks it is not the fault of teams and leaders on the ground.",jwgz6qm

That includes recently snapped managers that are now sales team, but still have to act as managers.  As an ARA myself with limited staff and a constant high demand (recently had over 30 items in repair), I push back against management as much as I can. It doesn‚Äôt always work, but standing up for your clients is good ethics. Please pick your battles carefully though‚Ä¶ A few strategies are:  - Offer to help briefly to answer questions or assist with a sale. Outright resistance is subordination, and will not be taken well. Work with them and they should work with you (though I know many managers are unreasonable‚Ä¶).   - Politely decline to be posted at an answer center. If no sales person is available, clients can work with a leader (who should be leading by example btw), or wait in queue like we do during the holidays.   - Remind them that NPS may tank due to extended repair times.   - Clients we have promised to work for take precedent over new clients. While we can‚Äôt outright refuse to help someone without just reason, we should not be taking on more than we can handle, nor should we jump the queue.

I have a degree in tech and join Geek Squad for experience in computer repair/IT that would get my foot in the door to better IT opportunities, and then trained and worked for my current position to learn more about tech, not sales üòÖ",jwgqlno
Yeah being over worked is an opportunity,jwhc5c0
"This is often not the case, although every store is different. While most ARAs aren't usually balls deep inside of a repair they often have other duties the sales floor doesn't understand. But some precincts are overstaffed and do have people dicking around.",jwhi103
"I was a CA for about 3-4 months before being an ARA but at my store we constantly had lines at geek squad/were constantly booked up by a couple days (the worst was 8/9 days) so the only ""selling"" I ever did was memberships (was lowkey kinda good at it before I became ARA too) but I never went on the sales floor unless it was to sell SSDs/RAM for clients.  So while being asked now to cover for ex: computers, yea I could totally get by by talking about specs, tho I have no idea what sales are currently running half the time (unless it's for parts then I gotchu) only have a half guessed memorization on how the brands are set up on the floor, have no idea where accessories are half the time either and then client tend to ask questions about other departments then im totally lost üòÖ  I won't lie tho, I've only been on the floor a hand full of times, and they've just been the not most ideal scenarios like: multiple people trying to ask questions at once, asking questions outside the computer department, asking the specific location of accessories I have no idea where they are (I do use the app to search), and then asking for general sales that Idk  So while I probably am seeing it as way more intimidating than it really is due to lack of experience, I also really really like focusing on my computer repairs in the back and reaaally don't wanna interact with customers, I have a personal bias against not really wanting to do sales üòÖ",jwhsck3

Ah see the words i like to use are ‚Äúweaponized incompetence‚Äù lmao,jwi335p
"Honestly? If the client is super nice, isn‚Äôt throwing any attitude, basically being a good human being, I‚Äôll do right by them, I‚Äôll ask the whole question of what do you need __ for and then give my best recommendation, and only offer Total if they plan on spending a ton of money at Geek Squad (fuck the credit card unless they specifically ask).   If the customer is an ass though? Treating me like I‚Äôm a dog and whistling to come to them? Or just straight up yelling at me or demanding a discount, I‚Äôll 100% just pull up the SKU of the product they asked about on the best buy app and just read it off to them. No deeper insights, no recommendations, just reading the description and whats in it.",jwi3mai

"I think its time to go.; Ive been with best buy about 4 years and took a LOA for a cpl months just to deal with some personal problems. I came back a few days ago and everything SUCKS. Customers, management, policy literally every 5 seconds on the walkie listening to management scream about BP and PMs. Obviously reading thru this sub i know im not alone. Im a full time college student so finding a job that will work around my schedule is a pain and im just not sure if I should just grin and bare it or gtfo.",15u9jff
"I mean, it‚Äôs no happy place. But I also think after taking an LOA, and depending on any toll endured during, it definitely heightens any discrepancies with the job when you get back.  When being with an employer for so long, it‚Äôs easy to see all the bad things, and especially when you take a good break, your mind almost expects and looks for them as almost a comfort ig. This has just always been my experience, with previous jobs.  Best Buy is in no great state as a company, and I know the sales floor is constantly enduring, I keep a walkie on the floor channel because I am often called out. You definitely are not alone, sometimes I just feel management gets crazy hate when they are usually getting the same throat shoving if not worse from district manage and up.",jwodudo
"I honestly think just grin and bare, or maybe hide out as product flow for a bit (million times less stress). As long as it isn‚Äôt following you home and affecting school or personal time, I think it‚Äôs worth keeping till you find something to replace.",jwoe1yf
"Snapped in June. Where I‚Äôm at now.; Hey all.  I was with BBY for 5 years.  Started as a sup, did some temp salary work, and finished as a GSM - snapped in June.  I wanted to provide a little perspective and share where I am today in hopes of helping those in similar circumstances or for the rest of you that have had enough.   First, I‚Äôd like to point out that I saw the snap coming, and was not surprised when I got the axe.  I saw the direction that the company was taking: less leadership, low/no specialization of line levels, and more top-level influence on site.  With this in mind, severance was my desired outcome, and it was nice to get handed a check to not come back again.   I‚Äôm not rich, but am in a good position financially, so I committed to two things in my job search:  1) I set up a system/rhythm that I confirmed to daily.  2) No applications for positions that paid less than what I was making when I exited BBY.  3) No applications for something I wasn‚Äôt interested in, regardless of pay.  4) Try like hell to avoid retail. 5) Apply to jobs not in my wheelhouse - look for a new path and emphasize transferable skills.  6) Take my time and enjoy the extended vacation.   I‚Äôve had a number of interviews since then, and what seems like 10x that number in rejections, but I wasn‚Äôt deterred and stuck to my system.  I‚Äôm starting a position next week that pays 15% more than my (capped) GSM pay.  In addition to a comparable benefit package, they also provide biannual reviews, guaranteed equity, and doesn‚Äôt require a flexible schedule. They told me they‚Äôd send me a laptop - assumed I‚Äôd be getting a Chromebook from the pre-COVID era, but instead I got an M2 MacBook Air.  have a slightly larger team, but there are no customers, which is a benefit in and of itself.  Before I started looking, I didn‚Äôt know this position existed, and while it‚Äôs in the tech field, it‚Äôs unlike anything I‚Äôve done before.   The point is that if you‚Äôve been laid off and you‚Äôre still looking, or if you‚Äôre looking for greener pastures, make sure you widen your approach. I don‚Äôt agree with the direction that BBY is headed,",15undf7
"sure you widen your approach. I don‚Äôt agree with the direction that BBY is headed, but as far as retail is concerned, it‚Äôs still an above average place to work.  You‚Äôre not going to escape shitty customers or new initiatives or flavor of the month KPIs just because you switch polos.  If you hate working at BBY, you probably don‚Äôt like retail. It takes courage to break away from the safety net that the retail industry provides - there‚Äôs almost no barrier to entry to land a spot, jobs are always available, and the promise of ‚Äúopportunity‚Äù is always there.  In reality, and with some exceptions, the real opportunity is outside of retail.  Get creative, and leverage your skillset to land at a place that understands your potential.   I always rooted for my employees at BBY, and I‚Äôm rooting for all of you, too.  Thanks for reading.",15undf7
Good for you! I was also snapped but have not been successful finding new employment. do you mind to share what field you got a job in now? I really don‚Äôt want to do retail anymore but not too sure what else is out there,jwqimee

"Funny stories (current and ex-employees) about of Best Buy miss?; I worked at BB as a Computer Sales Associate for 9 years in the 2010s and left at the end of 2020.  I remember how shitty the company was before Hubert Joly and thoroughly enjoyed all of the things Hubert did to improve all of the stores, including but not limited to cutting executive staff before loval leadership.  Stores back then had a family/friend atmosphere. Our store was the Wild West. We hooked up an iPod to the store‚Äôs speakers and would play music throughout the day and whoever got a Best Buy card, that associate could change the music station. (Pro tip: turning on Christmas music in July caused employees and customers to riot and complain to me to change it hahah)  Two employees got into a ball tag war where they‚Äôd randomly try and hit each other in the nuts while working. It spread like wildfire throughout the store.   An employee poached someone else‚Äôs sale that they had been working on for almost two hours that was $2k+. The employee who lost the sale walked by the poaching employee with a Game of Thrones box set and swung the box set up into the employee‚Äôs ball sack and caused the employee to drop to the ground. The employee took over and got his original sale back while the customer was dying of laughter.  It all ended when an employee was hit in the balls with a pair of airpods while carrying a 30 lb printer down the ladder and fell off and broke the printer haha. HR came in and inquired with everyone and everyone protected each other and didnt say anything, but the GM, who was a G, admitted it happened and laid on the grenade for all of us and got probation. We took him out and bought him some beers afterwards.  When the Force Awakens came out, there was a huge snow storm that effectively kept us from going  home so we all walked to the local movie theater where they gave us a special, free showing of Star WRs until the roads were plowed and salted.  We hooked up our phones to the bluetooth speaker demo products and would wait for the manager to walk through the department and contact customers in that section and then turn on a fart app and have the speaker loudly fart next to the manager haha. Manager was so embarassed and loudly chewed all of us out on the walkies.",15vfuy5
"I Can't Imagine; I was talking to one of my friends at another store. She literally broke down in frustration telling me her Samsung VPL put his 2 weeks in, her LG VPL is transferring to a different store and the person who got moved into a Core Sales position but was previously Home Theater so of course they would cover there a lot put their 2 weeks in. To be clear her frustration wasn't all the people leaving, its the lack of understanding about why the people are leaving. Money, working conditions, lack of appreciation. I told her I will be here anytime to talk but that has to suck to have all that kind of put on you, new people coming in, training them and getting them on par for the incoming holiday season. I would go mad knowing that I am nothing more than a drone for the company expected to keep a department running but be nothing but a drone with almost no appreciation for the amount of work put in. I know we are all struggling with the impending failure of this company that once was great but do they have to destroy the last bit of soul left in those of us who are sticking around?",15w5del
"Best Buy is a stepping stone for most people. When you factor in all the BS we‚Äôve had to deal with the last couple years, there‚Äôs no incentive to stay. The company has made it crystal clear that hard work and loyalty are not enough. We‚Äôre all replaceable.",jwz6zj2
"So leave. Everyone is leaving, there are better jobs out there.

"Silence Speaks Volumes; We literally had tornadoes and torrential rains rip through our area last week. There were extremely dangerous road conditions (tree branches falling, flooding, lightning strikes, physical tornadoes) yet nothing was said in our Geek Squad teams chat about a shelter in place or a ""hey everyone for your safety pull off the road"" or even a ""be safe!"". The only one to say that was a manager about an hour after the weather had passed. Their silence on the matter has spoken volumes to me and I know now that we are truly only numbers to this company. It's extremely upsetting and disappointing.",15x4pfj
"That's up to your managers and leadership and not the company. We get warnings for dangerous conditions, including heat and air quality, regularly in Teams. Corporate definitely doesn't care and it's not their responsibility, but your direct leadership (managers, squad leaders) not caring sucks.

Nothing except telling you how bad of a job you‚Äôre doing while the only person on the sales floor all day without a break,jx4m9sj
The good friend of the market director and GM. Someone who doesn‚Äôt ask questions when told to do something. Completely sales focused with no knowledge or care for other parts of the business. Likely will be the most unqualified employee with no real years of experience but is GREAT at getting on their knees.,jx4o0yi
What exactly do you mean? I'm curious about the position since I saw an opening recently.,jx32y1i
The pay is the exact same as to what a sales/ops ASM was,jx44xci
Thank you for the insight.,jx34uqy
"In other words, get ready to be harassed by your market manager on the daily when your store misses *any* membership goals, and they‚Äôll want action plans weekly on how you‚Äôre planning to get it back on track.  That‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs literally all upper management cares about because it‚Äôs the direction they‚Äôve chosen to dig the companies grave in. It‚Äôs not a sustainable model, but y‚Äôknow, corporate greed",jx447xn
And yet they combined 2 jobs into one for the same pay. A lot of stores went from having both a sales manager and an ops manager to 1 experience manager. Sorry but ‚Äúcongratulations you get to keep your job for the same pay but do twice the work‚Äù is a pay cut,jx4dalh

I have years of experience. I use to be a team lead at a different company. Every time I apply for something on iJOS, I‚Äôm denied. I‚Äôm talking about over twenty times in the last 6 months. I reach out to a recruiter for feedback each time. Some don‚Äôt respond but those who do just say others have been with the company longer or their background closer aligns to the role.

"Never used Reddit outside of finding the TLC log in; My name is T, jokingly called T-Rex at work which makes my day. I have been with my current Best Buy store since 2013. I have been through so many changes from departments to staff to memberships. Retail has always been described as a stepping stone job but the thing I loved about it was the customer experience. Helping people find what they need, not just what they think they want, solving the never ending problems in the electronics world and building bonds with customers. I have customers still to this day I've been helping since 2013. I've seen their kids grow up and seen some of them go off to college. I've learned a lot, grown a lot and tried to help those around me grow as well. I have gone through a lot with the company like cut backs, mass hiring, many holidays. I had an ASM Ramon who I could easily say was such a supportive and amazing person to guide paths for so many. 2018 I went through something that took a lot out of me mentally (my mom got really sick) and by 2019 she had left this world. Some of my Best Buy experience during this time was supportive. Being a person who had to take caregivers leave when it first released was a learning experience, asking for LOA when she went to hospice was disparaging when it was declined cause I didn't have the right paperwork, only to lose my mom before they approved it. Telling my GM I needed more time than the bereavement time allotted because I was going through a large amount of depression and anxiety and having him support me taking time. Making so many friends and watching them leave for school or other jobs. I was there for 24/7, Total Tech Support, Total Tech to even the new plan. Rallying behind decisions that obviously I have no control over but hoping to inform customers the best way I can. The moral has been so down lately and it takes a toll on the brain. Constant red floors due to lack of staff, people leaving, the grind for memberships (which I don't mind but I do feel like since I deal with so many repeat customers what more can I do if they have already gotten the credit card from me or the TTS to TT and conversions). I love helping customers and getting to learn about their lives. I just feel run down. Everyone is mad about the changes and most will just tell me if you aren't happy",15ysn49

Do I understand everyone's frustrations, yes, do I agree with a lot of them, yes, can I change it, no. All I can do is go day by day.

I got yelled at today (and called every name in the book to the host) because I wouldn't interrupt my customer (who I was checking out) to answer a ""simple question"" because I was the only person in the department today. I'm not even phased anymore when these people walk out. If Best Buy wanted to provide good customer service, they'd provide staff/hours to make that a reality.",jxdiy4q

I'm trying to get a list. built up.",162jj9o
"Looks like not a lot of people on here know a lot about this. We have call centers in Central America, North America, and Asia.   I'm not on that side of the world anymore, but from what I remember we have several centers in the US that are 3pl still, center in Panama, centers in the Philippines. There may be more but i can't remember. I don't think any are in Inda, but I think we do still have IT teams in India. We also have several W2 call centers in the US. Everyone owns something specific, but there are general lines where calls get dumped if the IVR can't figure out where to send it.  I think I know the company name you're looking for, but first what were you looking for with that information?",jxzbi4t
"They're mostly based out of India now. Some might be in south America for bilingual purposes. But anytime you call the help desk it's always India.  The bridge is still stateside, but the help desk and HR are outsourced.",jxxl7sk
"Is South American support any better than Indian support? My spanish is decent, so I try to get to the Spanish call centers when I can. I've also read that your chances of getting a Spanish call center worker who speaks English is also pretty good.",jxygia3
"I think it‚Äôs something like Accucenture or something like that, Accu something",jxz0ybn
"Sitel is one of the larger call center businesses- they‚Äôre probably the best if the bunch which is saying something. They‚Äôre not completely international- I know of at least one in Ocala, Fl. The thing with call centers is that they are easy to dump and get a new one- so what you have today may be different tomorrow. There is minimal accountability to them as their only job is read off of their monitor. We use them quite a bit in my current job, and they‚Äôre just as bad in my industry.",jxznktl

I know a lot of them work in the Philippines, and I think they also have teams in Panama and perhaps Guatemala.",jy0s9c6
Accenture.,jy0z6hz
"Going to see if they want to hire me to train their employees to better understand bestbuys systems. Getting tired of not doing something about it and the seemingly higher higher ups ups seemingly perfectly fine to let things stand.   Also, looking to see if any accountability can be had. Essentially if a cx comes in with erroneous information from 3pl, through recent interactions/breeze you can see the case the rep made. If it's an actual bestbuy employee that made the case, it's easy to see the organization structure of that employee, so you can get their bosses information if something needs to be addressed, or you can message the employee directly through teams to coach out something real quick. This accountability doesn't exist for 3PL call centers.   When I did work digital sales, there was a chicken guy that existed when transferring to another department (at the time I always transferred with the customer)  In that instance, I passed off the cx by having another rep reach out to them and I stayed on the line with the chicken guy. Nothing but roosters clucking. There wasn't an actual person on the line, just chickens.   I stayed on that line for 4 hours, refusing to believe that digital sales leadership has zero ability to get chicken guy fired. Also stayed on the line cause if chicken guy was with me, then there wasn't any chance of another transfer. Also, it made their numbers look horrible so I hoped with the stone walling of leadership, at least maybe someone in the 3pl call center leadership would see the long call, listen in, and then hold chicken guy accountable.   Didn't work though, swear chicken guy is still going strong as I have heard a cx or two cone in and say all they got were chickens on the line when needing help.  Anyways, at the time, I spent a good amount of my shift trying to find some more detailed information about our 3pl call centers to maybe, hopefully get a good contact number. Digital sales leadership at the time refused to give any info, didn't care, or just remained willfully ignorant of the issue.   I did find some documents with names. I think there were 3 names I found for different regions.  Today, when I generally googled, I came across Sitel (which is now called foundever) that I think bestbuy uses. SITEL sounds familiar. I haven't been at work since I've been on vacation so I don't have access ATM to",jxzg7mq
"been at work since I've been on vacation so I don't have access ATM to research internally.   Just doing some musing while I relax, looking for avenues to take my existing knowledge of bestbuy and use it as leverage to maybe get hired on at a 3pl company that offers call center services to bestbuy. But that's the reason.",jxzg7mq

"Imo, at least, south American were significantly better at resolution/understanding complicated issues, and more likly to put in good notes for escalations when needed. And also seemed more empathetic.  BUT, south American also had the chicken guy. ..  Don't know if he was ever caught, but someone set up their work from home in a chicken coop and then bounced so callers just heard chickens in the background.",jxypgmu
Employee finder in workstation works the same way as the etk employee search,jy0suwr
Omg I have 10000% transferred to the chicken line before when I first start,jxzhr5r
"Couple of points of view here..  Yes, there is absolutely accountability for 3pl teams. In fact, they have an enormous turn over rate which is actually a problem.   That leads my to my other point. If you want to really help, joining a 3pl company isn't the answer in my opinion. Even if you did and even if it was a training or QA role, you still may make a relatively small but positive move. If you really want to change that world, you need to move up through BBCC leadership. Usually a Sr. Analyst owns the relationship of a 3pl team, so that may be a good place to look into.  Next steps up (Associate Manager, Manager, Sr. Manager) you would have conversations with the 3pl Sr. Leadership, work with and own contracts, negotiate new teams etc.. then I'd say you can make a substantial impact.   As for chicken guy, if you get that information to the right team with the time you called and the number you called from, the leaders can absolutely pull the call. That said, 1 occurrence doesn't typically end in terminating that employee. Just like you or any W2 employee, it would usually be a verbal warning at first but if it's that agregious it may not be the first warning.",jy1no4w
"When they say HR is outsourced they just mean the calls to the HR hotline. Best Buy uses a 3rd party for the HR support center. Many companies do this sadly. They are just reading scripts and putting tickets in for many issues.,",jxybfvk
Just curious do you think they‚Äôll get rid of cs state side all together? I had a lady start working at a store not far from me and she said all USA based people where going to be laid off.,jy11izg
"Out if curiosity, roughly when did you start",jxzl2wy
"Thank you for the response. But chicken guy is popular. I swear I recognized the chickens.   But, in browsing, around, I found a wonderful excell file with lots of names and contacts of 3pl and a good amount of their structure. At least from the view from bestbuy. It's an old by about a year and a half, but yea.   I believe you in that you get the right email to the right person, you can get accountability.  The problem is the availability and knowledge to execute that path towards correcting 3P.  The lack of readily available info, seems very purposeful (which it likely is)  With how easy it is to find store information, then leadership information, etc of bestbuy grown employees, it really should be equally accessible for getting information and coaching to 3pl to fix issues.   Also,I'm looking for numbers. Bestbuy employee customer care is dwindling in favor of 3PL. I'm very curious what metrics leadership is using to justify this move.   If I had to guess. They are looking at heavily at call length and transfer and not much else. That's the only way 3pl can beat home grown CC. I know while I was in that world, when I got someone who had been ran through the call center transfer rodeo, I took as much time as needed to get the customer taken care of. Productivity on paper would be sacrificed, but a customer was taken care of.   If that gap in awareness or recognition that Home based BBCC are more likely to resolve the customers issues which usually means longer times on the phone with the customer, then that's a problem. And, imo, that's what the trend leads me to believe is happening. Some pencil pusher is just seeing black and white data and making calls off of that, or they have a leader who's even more disconnected from the actual problem making quick judgment calls.   I'm seeing that level of leadership through ignorance from market level to store level, so it isn't much of a stretch to believe that's also what is driving decisions concerning home based CC reps and 3pl ones.",jy1qloi
"Oh and do want to say, I really appreciate the recommended roles. I've thought about jumping ship to some of those roles. Might consider them a bit more if you feel they have a more direct line to what I'm passionate about fixing",jy1ruc5

Like okay, now I can get a 3% raise, once a year, for doing the same job that I was before?  I perform like a high pay grade employee. I don't want to be paid mid-grade. I already can't afford anything.  This is the 2nd time I've been on the shit end of the stick for BB's pay increases. It's better for the people who don't even work here yet.  Also, I'm reserving the right to discuss this. It's not my fault it hasn't been formally announced by the company yet. It's been a week.",165utsm
You‚Äôre unhappy you can now make more money? Out of all the things to complain about this isn‚Äôt it.,jyhizd0
"I want to say.. congratulations?  Hmm.. I kind of see your point, but at the same time it's not a good take. You now have the ability to actually make more money than before, and you're mad about it? I can tell you from experience it is very, very difficult to change the pay grade of any role and has to go through miles check offs. That means a group of people have been fighting for you for months, if not a year. Other roles were eliminated and yours got a pay increase, so congrats?  Another point.. if you're in the mid band, new hires are typically brought on at the low band. I say this because I have been in your position and when my pay grade was adjusted I was moved to the very bottom of the new grade. Anyone hired was almost assuredly making more than me even though I had years of experience in the role. In those cases, you can have a conversation with you manager on what you're worth. There is a compensation e-learning that also outlines what each band is for, so that could help your case. I'm hearing you're a little salty, but it may be to your benefit going into that conversation respectfully as in the end this pay grade shift is to your benefit.",jyi9tn2

"Just got accepted for a part-time position at Best Buy and I have a question in regard to leave of absence (Ontario); So the title pretty much says it all, I've just got accepted at my local Best Buy as a merchandiser/customer support position part-time of course. Although I am excited to start the first career of my life, something is worrying me...  In Ontario, we have a 90-day probationary period for anyone who starts a new job where they evaluate you to see if you are suitable for staying with the company long term. Now, normally I would not worry about this but due to unforeseen circumstances, I am put in a tight situation. You see, come November I have to leave the country to attend to some family matters overseas. This is something that I wasn't expecting and my family told me that I would be staying there for at least 3 months and now that I've just started working at the company I am not sure what to do. In fact, I start my first day on Sunday and I don't know how to approach my supervisor about this.  There are many questions going through my mind about this because I am really looking forward to starting work as I said earlier and I'm worried that I will be let go because of this inconvenience. I understand there are outside factors that are outside of my control but I really don't want this to spell doom to my newly appointed career at Best Buy because this is something that I've really been looking forward to as this is my first job. Do you think that I will be terminated or let go because of this? Will my supervisor be understanding of the situation that I am in? I know that the holiday season is right around the corner and I will have to leave just before the holiday rush I have a feeling that they will be rather annoyed that I will be doing this but again, it's outside my control.

"1. No more surprise layoffs. They need to be communicated in advance, and every effort to keep employees on must be made and proven to have been made before layoffs happen.  2. Better training. All employees deserve NEI and designated time training both on and off the sales floor.   3. Mandatory cost of living increases, regardless of pay cap for your job grade.   4. Better health insurance options.   5. No more comp plan changes for commission based sales people without employee agreement and recommendations.   6. No more labor cuts. FT 40 hours. PT 20-25 hours. To go along with this, no more scheduling against availability or overriding availability/normal days off. Regular scheduling options available to those who need it. Any shift picked up after schedule releases gets bonus pay.  7. Minimum start pay $17. Those not are $17 get raised to $17 + a % based on tenure/experience.   8.

Whole list is great, only other things I‚Äôd demand would be to Re-staff AP and make it an actual position that gets to use their AP office again instead of being a glorified greeter.   Best Buy has a horrific theft problem, especially with organized retail crime. See it all the time in alerts, there‚Äôs about 12 major groups across the country that target this retailer in particular due to how lax our security is. Either they steal displays, use shuck keys to unlock expensive items, or they break cages open, amongst other methods.   I can‚Äôt share what the company-wide shrink number was but store-level losses far outweigh what it would take to staff the role and treat it the way every other big box retailer treats security. Did the math a while back and it‚Äôs maybe 1% or so of the company‚Äôs gross profit. More competently trained people on AP = Less theft = less shit locked up = customers able to grab and go at will = business improves.",k03afqz

Waste your time at Best Buy; I've been here full time for almost a year. I've been told by a supervisor and the GSM that I would be a good supervisor. I make $16 an hour which pains me to think about. If I could get to $22 an hour I would be happy as I have greatly reduced my cost of living. I'm saving up for a house but at this rate it's going to take me years just to build up a 20% down payment. I'm trying everyday to be a good employee but what is the point when corporate keeps killing off all the good positions? I'm not in college. I'm trying to move up in the company to make an actual living. But as the months have passed I've seen two shift lead positions and two supervisor positions get eliminated. So what the fuck is the point of spending my time here? I not only have to compete for a better position against everyone else but I also have to wait for one of my two remaining supervisors to leave the company. And if someone else gets that single open position I then have to wait another untold amount of time for someone else to leave. I'm ashamed of myself and I'm ashamed that I work here. It's embarrassing and honestly has been making me depressed. I can't wait to get a different job.,16ha775
"Ah as someone who heard the same thing, don‚Äôt do it. I made a good amount of money as a sup, but that‚Äôs because I‚Äôd sacrifice lunches, days off, stay super late. Come in early. Attend every meeting regardless if I was off. And I was laid off. No security in that company.",k0cmnd6
"If you must stay in retail for supervisor pay, go to Lowe's or Target. Made $26 at Lowe's and started at $27.50 in Target. If you are chasing the ladder, I wouldn't stay anywhere more than a year. Especially if you see someone else get picked over you, it's just not worth your life trying to impress one company. Go fluff up your resume and get out there to apply.  Learn some jargon/verbage of the company before you interview and go get your money.",k0cz10c
"I would look elsewhere before moving up in the company. There‚Äôs no stability when moving up positions with the constant ‚Äúremodels‚Äù they do. Eventually you‚Äôd just get laid off regardless plus the pay is still laughably low for the amount of stress you‚Äôd have to go through. I really wanted to be an OPS manager but once they cut that, I realized I had no future at this company. I‚Äôm just waiting until a better opportunity arises. Good luck OP.",k0cljk2
It will take you Years to get there if ever‚Ä¶.,k0cp8pq
"Sorry to break your spirit,  they tell you you be a good supervisor to hype you up to do more leadership stuff at your lower pay thinking you will get a spot knowing it's getting eliminated or they have a friend to put in there . All while they chill and relax",k0dr38j
"Not to distract from the point you are making, but you don't have to save up 20% for your down payment anymore.",k0ct3n0
If you value your job don‚Äôt ever get promoted they usually target managers first when letting people go. I wanted to be a manager but after seeing how the stores have devolved to I changed positions away from sales,k0cldo6

You gotta find a retail store with a culture that doesn‚Äôt rotate their managers every 6 months to a year. Lots of sales driven stores are like this. If you‚Äôre looking for stability in retail sales you‚Äôre not going to get it. You‚Äôre better off working your way up in a grocery store or somewhere not as sales driven. Managers get shifted around and after 3-5 years the execs will make you want to quit unless you‚Äôre able to meet their unrealistic goals somehow.,k0doqov
"Me too. I used to drive home in absolute tears, punching my steering wheel at 2am, not able to eat cuz all the drive thrus were closed, and still having to show back up in 7 hours with a smile on my face.

It used to be that dedication and ""sticking it out"" were respected, but I've seen tenured employees with scads of experience passed over for the ""flavor of the month"" new-hire when one of these in-demand spots open. I've also seen nepotism too. If you're there for 1-2 years and don't feel like you're gonna have an opportunity (or like u/Suspiciously-Long-36 said, you get passed over), get out there and find something else ASAP.",k0d0dsp
This is true. But I do not want my money in escrow. I do not want to pay PMI. I do not want  to pay an even higher interest rate than what the averages are right now. And lastly I dam sure don't want to be stuck under an even higher total monthly payment than what I'm already going to have to pay with a conventional 20% down loan.,k0ctrce
"Preach. I was the cool manager until I had to actually manage then suddenly I was the asshole.  I once clocked in at 3pm and left at 4am middle of the holidays. Sales focused leader closing warehouse mind you. Left a note saying I got none of what was asked of me done in favor of other pressing tasks. And I was greeted at 11am with ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry you didn‚Äôt feel as productive as you could have last night, did you really not take a lunch?‚Äù (Meaning he checked my time card for some reason) ‚Äúno I took 15 to eat and I was right back out here‚Äù ‚Äúmake sure you‚Äôre always taking a lunch‚Äù and that was the end of the conversation.",k0d09rz
"On the retrospect, cost of housing isn‚Äôt getting any cheaper. Yoy the cost of a home is simply going to get more expensive. Purchasing a home now with an FTHBA and then paying towards that alongside your PMI, will get you into your home faster.

Saving $40000 on an entry level position is not realistic (not saying you can‚Äôt or aren‚Äôt able to, just takes so long)",k0cxm6b
It does take a long time. But houses are much cheaper where I live luckily. Also I intend on putting down enough to be able to pay an additional principle payment each month. I will do this for the sole purpose of avoiding the amortization rate as much as possible. This will require a significant down payment upfront  to get my monthly payment lower. Then and only then will I have space to pay extra towards principle.,k0czg8o
"If there‚Äôs Costco near you, try working at Costco.

Of course if you‚Äôre lucky enough to be a meat cutter, you get pay $30.90 (if I‚Äôm not mistaken).  Not to mention if you work Sunday, it‚Äôs 1.5 pay.  I have been working at Costco for 8 years, and last year I barely made over $70k.  I don‚Äôt have any college degree, and I‚Äôm not book smart, so this is best I can do in retail without going management level.  There‚Äôs no such thing as ‚Äúworking off the clock‚Äù because Costco doesn‚Äôt want to get sue for breaking law, so everything is while you‚Äôre clock in.

Every hour an employee from each department would walk the aisles of their department and check throughout the department up and down and report back to AP to report ""insert department is clear"".

"Question to my fellow sales team members; i‚Äôve been working at best buy for almost a year now. i used to mainly be a front end guy just doing returns, checking out people, in store pickups etc. recently about 4-5 months ago, my manager figured that since i have some sales experience outside of best buy that i should try pc sales since my knowledge on pcs is also strong. for those past 4-5 months i‚Äôve been leading my micro market with bps and membership units while being paid $15 AN HOUR.   regarding this, i even asked some new front end associates how much they made and of course they are making more than me. i was pretty shocked to hear and when i heard that the people below me in bps and tts were getting almost 2-3 dollars more than me, that‚Äôs when i figured it was time for my raise.   i‚Äôve asked for it, they said they‚Äôd give it but it‚Äôs been almost 2-3 weeks now and im approaching my year. i don‚Äôt know what to do atp. regardless, the reason why i got so set off was because i was the only sales advisor scheduled for truck till 9:00PM while everyone else was scheduled till 8:30. ended up closing 2 departments with that as well.   that really fed me up. and i‚Äôm starting to realize my worth. do you guys think i wait out my raise and see what they offer me or quit this job and go down the street to target tech   sorry for the rant thanks for reading thru‚ÄºÔ∏èüíØ",16mtxcj

best position?; i have worked for BB for a little less than a year and can easily say that ARA is the best position. not as much clients compared to CAs just you and a computer put on some good music and it‚Äôs easy. what other position do you think is the best?,16o66as

She refuses to learn and she constantly asks me to go answer these people's questions. That being said some of these senile fucks drive me crazy. I literally had a woman screaming at me because I gave her the charger for her laptop, when she put it in her car it went under the seat so immediately I guess geeksquad stole it. I showed her the video of her leaving with the charger and kindly told her it's probably in your car, it was, but I'm still the bad guy. Boomers are the worst part of my job. Now don't get me wrong not 100% but you get them frequently enough and it makes you question your life decisions.",k1jqv50

"Not necessarily a Best Buy story but a story nonetheless:  So I was headed home from a 10-4 shift with my fantasy football draft at 5pm. Traffic where I live normally takes me about 15-20 mins to get home. I clock out and head on my way. I get to the bridge that I have to cross in order to get from one city to another, and my tire completely gives out on me. Instead of taking my exit, I take the closer exit and there‚Äôs an auto zone right off the exit. I ask to borrow the store jack, every auto zone has one, and the manager says no. One of the store attendants comes outside to help me jack my car up with a scissor jack, the shitty one my car came with, and my car ends up falling onto the rotor in which the tire was missing. I was infuriated. The store attendant tells me to buy the jack from inside and return it and if the manager says anything about it, to contact corporate. I do just that. Buy the jack, change my tire, return the jack. Manager tells me she can‚Äôt return it because the store doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúrent‚Äù out jacks. I say ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt rent it. I bought it. I was unsatisfied. Now I want to return it.‚Äù The guy who helped me, bless his heart, faked a phone call and was pretending to talk to a customer saying ‚Äúyes, we can return parts. The money will be sent back to your card within 2-3 days. Yes, even opened parts.‚Äù Stuff like that. So she rips the receipt out of my hand, processed the return. I was standing there in my Best Buy blue shirt, and she says ‚ÄúI know I won‚Äôt be shopping at Best Buy anytime soon.‚Äù I say, ‚ÄúWe will not miss your business.‚Äù The next day, I got the guy that helped me out, the store attendant, a $50 gift card to a local steakhouse. And with the remaining $50 I saved by returning the jack, the jack was $100 at auto zone, I bought the same jack off of FB Marketplace for $50.

I explain the queue and tell her that the host will put her in for assistance, it won't be long. She disappears, I go back to processing returns.  Some time later, screaming comes from the appliance desk. It's the same woman, shouting about how ""you all have terrible customer service"" and ""I've never been treated this way, never had to wait this long"". I remember it so clearly because there was *venom* in the way she said ""never"", just complete anger and disgust at this crime. I turn to ask for her name, and look in the queue.

Went back and had some douche snap his fingers at me, as if I was a dog, to get me to help him in mobile. I just told him I was off the clock and went to get my water bottle. Walked back to the entrance when the guy stops me with my confused manager in tow screaming about how I was the worst employee ever and demanded he fire me for not helping him.

"No, they can not fire you for being injured due to work being the cause of the issue.  Contact HR before you talk to the managers and report your physical limitations and problems due to the working conditions.  I'm a warehouse employee myself so I can 100% relate to this. I do everything that is expected of a product flow employee and then some more. Shuttle and Planos are the most physically demanding jobs and you get no support with it either. 400lb fridge, 100 piece shuttle, multiple 85"" TV's etc etc. You name it, I've done it. My body is not the same as it was, yet BBY doesn't care. My peers and managers don't care. The CEO and share holders don't care. If we get broken nobody cares. All that matters to them is ""were you following sop"" for unloading/handling oversized items.  The physical toll it takes on us is unreal. Even with using the right Dolly's and the right lifts it's still an extreme task, multiple times a week to do these things on your own. It's always meant to be a ""team lift"" where needed, yet we fired and cut so many people and scheduled people the bare minimum that team lifting anything is impossible when you're alone or the other people in the warehouse are injured... essentially making you do it alone.  The sales floor doesn't help, they hide behind their registers in groups of 2 to 4 at a time with leaders laughing and joking while you break your back daily and they don't even have the decency or respect to offer help. They're happy to accommodate their lunches and work needs to get bonuses....but any type of team work where they might break a sweat or get dirt on their hands...think again.

Since then it has stayed mostly in the 70‚Äôs. Right now it‚Äôs $69.79. The highest I can remember seeing it for over the past year has been mid 80‚Äôs.

If it's gone down, you'd have been better off not buying it at all.  If it's gone up less than 5%, you'd have been better off putting your money into an interest bearing account or short term bonds instead of letting BestBuy borrow it for six months interest free.

Little known fact, it something is on sale, say from 1k down to 800, most of the time the manufacture still pays best buy the difference so long as no price overrides take place. So even if a product is on sale for ‚Äúmembers‚Äù, best buy still pockets the full gross revenue, as well as the money from the membership. They can absolutely afford to make it worth our wild by offering even $5 per bp or membership, but they wont. They dont see the net benefit in it for them.

Somehow after they ousted the commission on most products and restructured management, my weekly goal somehow shot up to $50k. We are in a smaller market, so that minimum goal of $50k/week was pretty rough. They also wanted a membership and a credit app every day.

So let's just say I was off 4 days and had a good time as a college guy and have hickeys all over my neck do I need to cover them up for work because I know how laid back my managers are about this stuff and I went in on my day off to buy something and they didn't say anything but I'm that wasn't my gm who will most likely me there tmmr when I go in.

Took over a 2+ year dark install bay and my 2nd year there, was about to get added headcount as it was add 60 hours every week. Then came Corrie and Covid. Bonuses stripped and bay was shut down moving me to another location. I was turned down for Supervisor spots for the past 5 years that I was more than qualified for and watched them give them to people with less experience and 0 skills. There was a GM while I was Autotech that didn't like how I wasn't there to fuck around or let him have parties in my bay and use it for storage. I let him have it one day when he tried to report me to HR for something he didn't even understand.   I watched this company slowly fall apart and kill off all their good employees who had been there for many years, a lot of skill and knowledge left just so they could save a few bucks while they fly around in private jets and  run the company deeper down the shitter. My new GM of the past 6ish months decided to try to pull some bs on me a few times lately, blaming me for situations he created. I'm pretty sure this was retaliation for some things I said in the Blueprint Survey as his attitude changed completely towards me right after the results came out. My old GM who went out of his way to make sure I didn't move up now runs the micro market and I definitely saw a change in him towards me to the point where he didn't even acknowledge my existance the past several weeks since the survey.   I was pushed out by 2 managers who don't know their heads from their asses. I had enough and walked out after putting up with all this for over 5 years. What really triggered me in the end was being told that I don't  care about the customers when I would always go over the top for every install I did. People loved me and my NPS reflected that.

No worries. When you do the I9 depending on the hire date set and some other backend things it can take anywhere form a few hours to a few days.

I have witness at similar companies that management will agree on working around your schedule, but then when push comes to shove and they need a worker that day.  They tell you its not their problem and you need to figure it out and they schedule you to work.  I am not saying Best Buy is this way, but the industry sure is.

I told them I cannot work on Mondays and Wednesdays, also on Tuesdays before 2pm. Every other day I could work from opening to closing. They ended up scheduling me for Monday afternoon, Tuesday morning, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday.   So they gave me a full time 40 hours, two days when I can't work, and in the product flow position which isn't sales from my understanding; it's warehouse. I had to remind them three times to change it; when they made the mistake, at my lunch, and when I clocked out. They finally changed it when I said I won't be coming in at all.  My revised schedule is Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday this week at 32 hours. It still says product flow, but I'll see how and what it is when I work on Thursday.

But back to your narrow minded thinking, have you thought that MAYBE I was a burnt out employee? Who have maybe worked OPEN to CLOSE the last 4 days because I know all about the minimum staffing.   So since you like to think narrowly let me broaden you up a bit. My schedule was changed without me being aware. Last I checked I was off today, for which I made plans to spend the day with my daughter because she is out of school today. So I received a phone call stating I was on the schedule to work.

It's offshore. They sent all our positions off shore. Those of us who actually worked for BBY the last few years and weren't offshore didn't do this crap. It is always offshore doing it. They say yes to everything to get the good surveys which drives their metrics. It's why corporate said customers were more satisfied with their performance. Because they said yes to everything and filled out surveys saying good things. Then those of us who had the awesome job of explaining when those customers called back that no we cannot do XYZ even though the person they spoke to last time promised we could....they filled out the new survey giving us crappy scores because of them. It's a vicious cycle. After Christmas all calls will be going offshore so brace yourself.,k554kg5

As long as you come in understanding these things will happen and don't get your feelings hurt easily you'll be ok. The best way to protect your morality is asking every customer to take the survey to show leadership your customers value the service you provide, it won't keep you from ""coachings"" but could protect the hours they give you. The top 3 are excellent surveys (if the customer is a ass don't ask them to take the survey) Best Buy credit cards (because BB gets a kick back off every card (this can be useful and save you customer money)) and paid memberships (this one can be beneficial to your customer but is a yearly auto renewal for the morality part you need to make sure they are aware it renews every year unless they cancel and if they do BB total all the service plan will end when they leave).

"""Employee Discount is 5% over cost. You also get a discount on services Best Buy sells. If the markup is less than 5%, you pay the retail price. You'll always pay the lowest price available.   **The discount kicks in after 30 days of employment. Between November 20th and December 31st, however, everyone can make purchases despite their respective hire date.**  Discount is for personal use only, and you cannot disclose your employee purchase price since it is confidential information. Eligible users include you, a spouse/domestic partner, and dependents under the age of 23. Eligible family members can come with and pick-out an item for themselves, but you need to buy it. All non-cash payments must be made in your name. They can't use your Employee number & ID to purchase a product on their own.  To check the discount on an item, copy the SKU and navigate to the Personal tab on ETK. Paste the SKU on the Employee Price Check section. You can learn more about the Employee Discount Policy on 'My HR'.""",k5tu217

Best way to sell a BB protection?; My boss is crazy about BestBuy protection plans and demands that we even have a daily quota which is crazy. What tips can you give me?,17ec504
Don't let them bother you. I'm in the same boat as you are and the best advice I can give you is to try to find value in the Plus or Total membership for the customer. Of course even if it saves them money and gives them peace of mind they may not take it. It should be a natural part of the conversation and not something you just bring up randomly. It's why getting to know your customer's problem is so important. You match what they need with the benefits of a membership and see if it'll provide value for them. If not it never hurts to ask just in case but ultimately don't sweat it if you don't end up getting the membership. BB business model is awful and it's not your fault the company relies on those memberships to make money. Take what I say with a grain of salt though I rarely ever make my daily quota. They expect me to sell memberships to people looking for usb sticks lol.,k62h2r4

"It has nothing to do with sales, it's about the availability of that item online. Sure music is online but vinyl is more of a collector item for those that buy them and it offers lossless playback. I'm in a 35k store that's been remodeled and pre remodel we had 50-60 feet of 4 or 5 row DVD shelving and we had a single row of 8 feet of vinyl records. After the remodel we have 0 DVD space and still 8 feet of vinyl. Our video game shelving is half the size too because digital games are available and Xbox specifically sells cheaper consoles that are digital only.

"New employee noticing the disfunction; I‚Äôm a new warehouse employee. I have a decent career making decent money, but things are expensive now.   I was looking for a part time job and got one in the warehouse. The hiring manager told me she liked me and feels like I would be a good addition because everyone‚Äôs work ethic is.   First day I go in and do computer trainings and that was it. Was never given any further instruction on where to go or who to talk to for training. Haven‚Äôt even seen my manager since, and basically have had to fend for myself. Asking where to go and how to do things.   Here‚Äôs the thing. I notice so much disfunction in the warehouse. People complain about having to find things or how they can‚Äôt find anything. But every time there isn‚Äôt a spot to put something and I ask what to do with it, they just say ‚Äújust put it anywhere man‚Äù. Like yo‚Ä¶that‚Äôs why we can never find anything.   What‚Äôs most annoying is that I can see why the managers are frustrated, BUT ITS THEIR FAULT! If things are messed up and you have a problem with the work ethic of the people currently working there, why would you let the same people train the new guys? Like get your hands dirty and be involved in new hire training. Otherwise the same cycle will just continue.    Rant over.",17lnjrw
Welcome to Best Buy. The dysfunction will continue,k7fgxb1
"It only gets worse. It mostly happened when best buy laid off nearly all their warehouse sups and warehouse managers when they did a shuffle of leaders. Those who remain were forced to convert into other positions and operations has basically died in best buys eyes.... because they killed it intentionally.   Those who remain are typically new hires or senior staff who are trying to hold it together. The leadership we have now are sales leaders....the people who have 0 experience with operations yet think they know everything, yet know nothing. It won't get any better. Give up hope and lower your expectations. Me and a few others are holding it together but are in the same boat. The only saving grace with me and my peers is our work ethic  and the need to have a functioning warehouse because it affects us more than the sales floor. It's rough, but we're holding it together. Don't rely on your leadership, rely on your peers. It's the only way you'll survive the holiday season. A few good players can hold the fort down, against all odds.",k7fiejl

"Well, as seasonal, you aren't guaranteed any hours at all. Generally they will shedule you 2 maybe 3 days a week at the most as busniness demands.

When I was looking at the func check to see who processed the return, I noticed the item was purchased in September.  When I pulled the original receipt the customer did not have a membership so the return was processed out of policy.  I spoke to a manager to see if they knew anything about it and they informed me that they talked the customer into purchasing a membership in return for processing the return.  He looked dumb founded when I told him the TV that was returned was missing the stand.  I also tried to explain to him that the customer could literally get a refund and then just go home and cancel the membership.  Again I got blank stares.  I understand why memberships are important to the company but some of the tactics managers are using to get them seem so crazy and shady.",17oqjex

However, you can go into the system and turn off the auto renewal if you know how to through their profile.  You can even cancel the membership and return/refund the customer.  However, management at my store doesn't allow us to do that.  They make us tell the customer they have to call to have it cancelled and refunded.  That's a completely different fight I've had with them multiple times because it's not really SOP.  It's only a way for them to try and save their numbers.",k80xya1

Yes. Best buy makes little to no money on physical merchandise sold so discounting items actually makes the company lose money.  The companies real money comes from credit cards (citi bank pays best buy like 1-2k for every application) and memberships (pure profit for geek squad services).,k8l8gjm

As the other user mentioned there's a specific process to doing it. If it's shuttle it's about accuracy, not just speed. Don't cut corners and make sure you read everything carefully on RSS and are not just blindly loading and unloading trucks. Doing shuttle is 2nd nature to me along with truck validation.

"For our store, it‚Äôs pretty straightforward. Driver will back up, you‚Äôll get paper from them. We‚Äôll pop open the trailer door and usually there‚Äôs a tote of straps and an envelope with manifest info and seals. The seal you put on when you‚Äôre done is the just a +1 from the seal you took off (I.e. if seal you take off is 111111, next will be 111112 ). On the tc, I‚Äôll log into rss and go to shipping and receiving. You can find the manifest number from the paperwork in the envelope or search using your DC‚Äôs number and a marking a shipped status. It‚Äôll pull up the manifest on the tc, and there will be a little arrow near the top for a drop down menu. From there, I go into manifest validation scan units as I pull them off. Once everything is unloaded and validated, I‚Äôll usually suspend it and back out. I‚Äôm not sure on other stores policies, but you can receive it there and have the picks come through for units. If you have anything to load, go to shipping and receiving, and under the containers tab hit the plus button. If there‚Äôs geek squad units (they‚Äôll have a white container instead of red, as well as a pink slip usually) you‚Äôll hit unload trailer. You‚Äôll have to scan the BOL number, usually really long and on the paperwork the driver handed to you or from the envelope. Then you‚Äôll scan the white containers to ‚Äúunload‚Äù those units. After that, RSS will ask you if you want to load that trailer. This is for haul aways, service units, etc. you can hit yes and scan the containers to load them. (If you have nothing to unload, just hit the same plus button and just go to the load trailer option, then scan containers of units ready to send off. If there‚Äôs nothing to unload or load, forget this step). If you loaded units, when you complete the loading, some paperwork should print out. 3 copies. You‚Äôll sign your name and date under shipper on all these copies, plus the paperwork the driver handed you. Go out to the driver, giving him his paperwork back. Then you‚Äôll have him sign the other 3 copies of the paperwork you printed. He‚Äôll keep one, one will go in the envelope, and the last you‚Äôll",kax6d02
"He‚Äôll keep one, one will go in the envelope, and the last you‚Äôll keep. I ask the driver if he wants a thumbs up or three kicks on the door to send him off.

"Yeah...... You kinda hit on the main problem. The customers have ALWAYS expected the one thing that Best Buy has historically provided: the 'expert' in a blue shirt.   Because of our near criminal understaffing, the customers have NO ONE to get even the simplest of questions answered. Differences between models? Which one is better? Is this in stock?   Fuck, we can't even price everything..... ""I just wanna know how much this is. Do you have a price checker?""  Customers are mad that we can't even make good on the most basic of store functions. You shouldn't be made to help customers with products if you don't have product training..... But then, no one gets training, SOOOOO... üòÆ‚Äçüí®",kby89qr
"A tip from a fellow warehouse guy, if you do in fact decide to help on the floor, tell the customer right off the bat that you're a warehouse employee and you don't know much about the product, but you'll help as best you can. If they want to be an ass then they'll just tell you to piss off, otherwise they'll at least be patient.",kbzh4m6

"In your spare time if you have a chance to do some of the E learning, I have found that it helps me become more familiar with some of the products. There are times where certain products I won‚Äôt know anything about or what it is but I just look up on my Best Buy app and try to find the product or something similar so I can point them in the right direction. For the E learning I try to find things I‚Äôm more interested in so I can retain the information better or at least if I am not familiar or interested I know of the brand and I have somewhat of an idea what they are talking about. For example, some customers will ask me about CORSAIR and I am not an expert on that whatsoever but I was able to lookup what they needed with the SKU number or brand name and point them in the direction of the isle. When they ask me specific questions about the product I try to resonate with them and if I honestly don‚Äôt know the answer I will look it up or try to pull up the features tab on the app under the product information to see if anything in there will answer their question. It can be a pain because the customer has to wait for me to answer but usually they appreciate the effort and if they get upset I usually just be like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I am not super familiar with this product but I can pair you up with someone who would know more about it if you up to wait until they are available to help you‚Äù so it doesn‚Äôt sound like I‚Äôm completely helpless.",kc0slzo

"We do and I absolutely do offer it, we actually set him up with one. It wasn‚Äôt my first option because this conversation was during a pickup for a receiver, center channel, and bookshelf speakers to add to an existing setup and he just wanted to speak to someone to confirm he got the right things and about recommendations.

But my supervisor had me set it up anyways because the gentleman was open to upgrading the setup if feasible.",kbzd82u

Verizon VPL; 5 days a week our only mobile coverage is a Verizon VPL and I think she‚Äôs getting shafted. She‚Äôs mentioned to us that one week that she got no spliffs because that pay period was all AT&T activations. It‚Äôs obvious she isn‚Äôt supposed to do that so my question is what are the consequences?   Like should I stop signing into coreblue for her?,18fj34y
I'm a Verizon VPL as well and I'm always alone. No other mobile associates in my store and nobody knows how to do activations besides me. I also seem to be always activating AT&T and never get any spiffs üôÉ Maybe you should just do the AT&T activation and call it a day,kcuhb8o
"My store is only VZN now. No more ATT. Only one Verizon VPL and ........ Get this..... REPS!!! That's right, our Android, Samsung and Chromebook reps ring customers, take cash, and get secured product!   While they can't activate, it's still insulting.",kcujbn4
You should be doing the activations yourself and not having her do the work and you getting the money for it. It was never designed to be like that and if corporate catches wind you could both be penalized or loose your jobs for doing it.,kcujtib
My last 6 months in my 7 years at Best Buy was as Verizon Vpl. Drove me to insanity that it was Two Verizon and one Att vpl running mobile.   Had to have people sign in for att or any mobile sale but Verizon but only spiffed for Verizon. Best Buy owns Lively and they always told us we worked for Best Buy but had to have someone else sign in for lively no spiff.  I will say going to work for T-mobile best thing I have ever done,kcumc78
Welcome to Best Buy where the abuse of VPL labor across all departments is the norm.,kcvqzgx
I‚Äôm a Verizon VPL as well and also the ONLY full-time mobile person. I am constantly activating AT&T and getting no spiffs while doing it. All of the managers are perfectly ok with this and will even sign in themselves so I can do the activations. I‚Äôm doing twice or more the work and getting no benefit.,kcw4mhh
"I usually do, at least if I‚Äôm free and able to. I did all my mobile training because I hated how TWO people had to do the work of 3-4 and now it‚Äôs such a shit show.

Those days when I‚Äôm getting yelled at because customer don‚Äôt realize they owe U-verse money really makes me understand why lol.",kcuizon

"**The best time to start was yesterday. The next best time to start is now.**  There's a reason '**Union**' begins with '**U**'.

"To those who left years ago and think a union would be dumb, you haven't kept up with nor experienced in the past few years alone. You have jobs being eliminated at much higher rates and numbers than ever before to be replaced with part time or 3rd party labor. People doing 15 other people's jobs with no pay increase. Many people who don't get lunch breaks or are told to work off the clock due to reduced labor with no overtime lest you be written up/put on a final/fired.   Profits are higher than pre covid and the company is spending less money on training and employees while continuing to find new ways to increase profits while lowering headcounts.   HR is a joke, a call center in India! Employees required to use their personal devices to perform their every day duties.   I think a union would be a good idea right now, especially when it comes to the Geek Squad Agents who get it 10x's worse than any blue shirt in store. Everyone is being screwed over while the high ups line their pockets before the company goes bankrupt. Best of luck to you all!   -former employee",kcuvdx9

Couldn't tell you how many Edgars were there laughing it up in the middle of the department. Made it to home theater and Didn't get a care in the world while the employees stood around chatting with their thumbs up their ass. Left home theater with a ""do you need help?"" after I've already grabbed my item after looking all over for it. This after employees walked right on by. Waited till you saw you could tack on something right? Most of y'all are useless, and coming from a former employee, I was useless too. I embraced it and apparently so do a lot of employees too. Maybe it's karma but I didn't expect a raise for my shit work. Sorry but I don't feel too bad when the raises don't happen when the majority of the store is shit.",kcvybb5
"Because corporate isn't going to entertain the possibility. Corporate is willing to fire anyone and everyone to avoid that happening.   I'm generally pro-union, but I've been in corporate retail long enough to the lengths the people at the top will go to avoid their workforce becoming unionized. Especially with Best Buy's market, they'd be far more likely to shut down their brick and mortar stores entirely and switch to a fully online model, if the alternative was dealing with a union.   It sucks, because it would probably be a better situation for both employees AND corporate, but they see a union as a potential problem, and nothing more.",kcv2dhy
Unionization is not going to fix earnings.,kctuwuj

"So tell me what a union would do for me? An employee that was treated right, always did my job and never complained? What benefit would a union give me?",kcumy98
"While your concerns are valid, employees today are told to look at customers like walking credit cards and memberships. If you‚Äôre getting an accessory like a sound system, chances are you‚Äôve either already got a card or membership or you‚Äôre not going to get one. It‚Äôs not right, not ethical, and completely absurd, but if there are two customers, one buying a sound system and one buying a brand new computer, management will tell employees to go to computers then home theater to get the membership and credit card. I agree with your take, but that‚Äôs just how management is nowadays.",kcwa85q
"I'd agree that corporate is likely to go to extremes to prevent Unionization. One of the most important steps to ensure this doesn't happen is starting off 'underground', slowly building support without letting management know until you have the 30% needed to begin a vote, or even the 50% to directly form one.",kcvp795
"Well, my rebuttal to your opinion is smile direct club. That company was arrogant and had the same mindset you described and thought they could rehire positions that were quitting left and right.

What do earnings have to do with not doing billions in stock buybacks with our profits instead of using it for wage increases for the people doing the actual work?,kcum4q2
"They can knock it off with the BILLIONS in stock buybacks. Or cut back the dividends they pay out. They have plenty of money they could have used to do some of these things years ago, but they‚Äôre legally required to do the maximum for shareholders.

It's been proven that union dues pay for themselves through higher wages.,kcu3few
"It helps protect every worker in the union, and statistically results in higher wages, and yes, that's AFTER any ""dues"", which for most retail positions tend to be around $200... a year....  Not everyone gets to be in a position where they're always treated well, a union protects people from having their positions randomly eliminated or being put into different roles or stores against their own wishes. We've seen this happen to so many people so many times in my own store I don't know how you can act like this simply doesn't happen to best buy employees especially",kcunwhs
"Like I said, even if they vote to form a union, corporate can still just fire everyone under the guise of ""restructuring"". It all depends on what they see as a bigger cost to the shareholders.",kcwfjvm
"*Attempting* being the key word there.   I'm in no way agreeing with the corporate position, but that is the position they have.

"You're not wrong, but the problem isn't one of logic. It's one of capitalism.   Corporate only cares to do things that makes the stockholders happy.

"Your problem is you're thinking of the now rather than the long term. it doesnt matter if they save $4 now if they'll save $500 for the remainder of the memberships. As for the credit card, yes you should have at least some ethics, like don't apply them for a card if they tell you their credit score is in the shitter, but you should still let them make their own choice. Just explain how they work to the best of your ability and let them pull the trigger",kcskafp

Multiple people have said it but here are the facts: we are not the bank. We are not their financial advisor. We are not their mom or dad or significant other. We are advisors at a for profit company. The only job we have is to explain your options and let you choose. How you say it can go a long way. For example all my employees are coached to offer whichever sounds enticing with open ended questions (which one sounds best for you) but if they dont want it THEY have to tell me no. With this thinking in mind if they deny you that's on them not you. Plenty of people in this sub will tell you we know which benefit is good for a specific situation. If a customer says no then that's their answer,kcto1t7

"I understand that because I know that *I* can't afford the membership, so I don't like having to sell it to customers; I'm sure a lot of them are in the same boat that I am, or in even worse condition financially. Convincing people to enter into an automatically renewing payment feels wrong to me too, because it's so easy to forget that you've signed up for something like that and then you're suddenly getting charged for something you didn't even know you had. I try to offer it anyway just so the managers don't come after me, but the only times I actually try to *sell* it is when there's some kind of offer, like if you get the first year at a discount or something. Otherwise it just doesn't seem worth the effort of going through a whole spiel to me. If a customer says no I don't want to argue with them.

I explain the benefits and why I have a card and membership, but you don‚Äôt need to pressure them into anything. Just make sure your offer rate is high. I‚Äôve overheard a few people in my store pitching like used car salesmen, which seems super scummy. I never lie to anyone, but I do tell them that if they shop with us more than a couple times per year, they have the potential to save far more than the cost of membership, especially if they plan on buying a new phone or computer. As for the card, I sell it as a way for them to get something with more longevity without needing to pay the whole thing up front. Or if they‚Äôre buying a $2000 tv with a debit card, I talk up the rewards.

"Yeah I am a seasonal, And they kept pulling me aside to keep asking for BP‚Äôs & Memberships, I still haven‚Äôt gotten a Membership & I‚Äôve already worked 10shifts on the front end. I honestly stopped asking every person & just only ask a couple, Because I can tell already they‚Äôre not gonna keep me. How do I know? Well first off they treat me differently from the other seasonals getting Bps & Memberships. And 2 they‚Äôre not scheduling me as much as the other Seasonals. So in retaliation, I am not gonna bother helping them get BP‚Äôs & Memberships. I am not ultimately giving up on selling them, Its just i am not gonna bother whenever there is not a manager around. Before I decided to do this, I was asking every customer even if they were buying a drink & they kept telling me ‚ÄúNo not today or thats okay‚Äù. Even though I was just pitching the same as what my supervisors were telling me to do & still nothing. And when I do get BP‚Äôs I never even get celebrated over comms like the rest of my seasonal co-workers do. So I still ask just not as often. But it‚Äôs unfortunate that this is all they care about, I have multiple customers acknowledge how helpful I am to them, And all my managers care about are if I‚Äôm selling these Bp‚Äôs or Memberships to customers who most of them can‚Äôt even afford another credit card or membership.

Just started working for geek squad about 3 weeks ago. The way my manager taught me how to sell total tech was to explain to the customer that any service they want to do with us will cost $150 without the membership so it would only make sense to spend the extra  $30 and get all services covered under the membership for the next year. I do that with every non total tech customer and I‚Äôve had a pretty easy time selling the membership doing it this way.,kcv8s25

But I don't think over ever tried to actually sell the credit card, I think that's something that you should thoroughly research on your own and not just jump into signing up for if you weren't previously planning on it.",kcsoecl
"Usually it's something like  ""I'm interested in a computer""  ""sweet, what's your budget looking like?"" ""I don't have a lot rn, so my max is $3-400"" ""Ok cool, lemme show you what we got rn"" If we have laptops that save them money so that they stay in budget with plus or total I advertise it and tell them to cancel it before it renews if they don't want it anymore. For the credit card I only bring it up with they ask. I want customers to research something like a credit card on their own time and make an informed decision without being pressured into it during a sale.",kcsrwq3
"That's my plan. Applying to a bunch of places after I couldn't take the constant ""hey can we roleplay a bit about selling our benefits to customers?""",kcv4q3j
"It's going to happen anywhere you are in the building. My ""three times"" is early, middle and then end. The third time I ask are you sure?  Most people stop after the first no. Just remember if you build no rapport you're just some random person talking about a credit card and some cool new membership. Think about that",kctusis
Exactly my point. How many good relationships happen in 1 minute? Last time I checked‚Ä¶None!  Relationships take time just like your relationships you built at work with your colleagues. If you know someone else offered the card but still haven‚Äôt taken care of the customers Wants and Needs‚Ä¶.Ask yourself were you really listening?,kcv16eo
"How are you going to feel if you sell them a Switch, don't mention BBT, and they break next week? Or, how are you going to feel if you don't mention the credit card, and they put it on 30% APR credit card they already have, when they could have got 12-months no interest?",kcut260
Make a connection. Sometimes if the girl is cute and wearing braces I'll ask about them,kctvpxc
I absolutely despise those roleplays. And multiple co-workers quizzing me on the Plus & TotalTech memberships. But goodluck on the job hunt! And I hope whatever you find is better!,kcv74j1
"If someone else already offered the card and the customer is at customer service to checkout then yes. I ask the customer how there day was going, I ask them about there holiday plans, I talk about the items they are buying, I make jokes with the customers, I always tell them to have a wonderful day. I'm an EXTREMELY social person, I love to talk with others and strangers are no enemy to me. The customers wants and needs do not demand for a credit card or membership, if they said no to my colleague who spoke with them then they do not want/need it.",kcv1knv
"I won't feel bad, I offer protection on all my items because in reality total is only good protection wise if you buy a lot of tech or if the warranty we offer is more than total for the same amount of time. If this is a parent buying a gift for their kid or something I'll just offer the warranty that's like $60 for 2 years. Rather than them paying $360 for 2 years of protection. And the credit card thing is entirely the individuals decision, I think all people are responsible for doing their own research and making an informed decision on their card. I think the advertisements all over the store reminding them of the credit card and the message on the payment pad is more than enough info for the customer.",kcuz65j
Isn't that manipulating them? Like trying to connect with them personally to convince them to buy something they otherwise never needed? It just feels like being a car salesman,kctx9cx
"I know it reads odd. I‚Äôm on your side here. Just want to add some ammo for those feeling less than! All of yous! Keep showing up everyday and showing out! Find that thing that makes you smile and forget about the TT and BP totals and focus on each convo. Keep listening to your customers and being yourself that‚Äôs what got you employed! Have fun with it, because that‚Äôs why you joined and that‚Äôs why the customers bought into BBY! #YOU üíØ",kcv2ugl
"Also, to add on. Part of the reason that I dislike the card is the fact that we are told WE must be the ones to educate customers on it and bring it up 3 times in a transaction meanwhile the benefit of us actually getting a customer to do it is none. Managers get a bonus for our effort and all we get is the bonus of not getting fired for underperforming.",kcv2uiq
"What if they buy, literally, two things in a year? What if they want something that Total covers that GSP doesn't? (data transfers, screen protector install...) What if the price drops in 16 days?  And, people don't read payment pad prompts. You know that. Lol",kcuzorp
Working at Best Buy is a stepping stone to being a Car salesman,kcubhmn
"Trust me, I would definitely mention it more if I didn't get so many peoe who interrupt me mid sentence to go ""no I don't want any of that just check me out"" and then complain that the pinpad asks them 3 different questions just to pay. Sales floor should mention plus/total and the credit card if it benefits the customer. Customer service/checkout should just check them out, double check they aren't missing out on genuine instant savings, ask them about their day/be friendly, and then wish them a happy holidays and a wonderful rest of their day.",kcv25ft
"Which is all true. Maybe, keep it short and sweet? Offer BBT the same way that you offer GSP. And, offer 10% back with card. Two short sentences which should be spaced separately in the interaction.",kcv2qqo
"That's what I've been trying to do recently. Gets harder to sell a product when the person telling you to do it is only doing it to get a bigger bonus knowing that it doesn't benefit you at all and that they can hold the fact that you aren't making their bonus bigger over your head with the threat of being fired for underperformance. The system is fucked, I hope Corrie Barry trips and eats dirt someday.",kcv3ktt
"There are definitely times where salespeople are promoted to managers, when the skillset of a salesperson and manager are different. But, at the end of the day, nobody knows more about a chstomer's buying habits than the customer. You inform. They decide. Next.",kcv40fn
"Agreed. But informing is a 1 time thing. A simple ""are you interested in 10% back with the my best buy credit card or our best buy total membership that will give you protection on all your items"" that's the most I ever say and I get told I'm not pitching hard enough. And it's always the managers who never have to actually pitch the shit and haven't gotten a membership in months because they only stand around at the host desk all day who berate you about it.",kcv4ey5
"Too wordy and robotic.  ""Do you want to cover this router, in case it messes up again?""  At the tail end...  ""Want $100 (actual amount) back by putting it on a Best Buy card?""",kcv4q78
"These I can get behind. It tells the customer what's actually going to help them. I can always then continue the coverage question with ""yeah, we have our standard gsp for (amount and time) or we have a total subscription for (amount) that covers anything you buy in-store as long as the membership is active."" I just couldn't take the ways I'm asked to pitch things, recently a manager told me that if the benefit is over $50 on an item to just tell them they have 2 choices, plus for free or total for the amount it is with the discount. Which to me is OBVIOUSLY trying to scam a customer into agreeing to a yearly subscription and not informing them until later in the transaction where they are less likely to back out since they already said yes.",kcv5gdv
"Get the ""yes"" for coverage first. Then, ""$60 to cover this one item or $180 to cover everything you buy for a year."" Don't overthink the subscription piece. Even if they receive an unintended renewal (which is kinda ridiculous, considering how many emails they get...), they have 30 days to get a full refund on the renewal.",kcv5uzf
"Maybe it's just the customers in my area as well but omg they are all old, pissed, and hate credit cards and subscription plans. The amount of ""WHAT IS THIS CHARGE ON MY BILL WHY DID YOU CHARGE ME $180 THIS IS BULLSHIT"" followed by me having to remind them of the membership they signed up for a year ago and them denying it with all their heart and then me refunding them. The credit card thing is worse, I just try to do my job and advertise the card and I get ""you know credit cards are horrible right? Your company is horrible for having a credit card and is ruining people lives""",kcv6fd8
"There is a shocking lack of personal responsibility in today's world. But, at the end of the day, you can't force grown ups to grown up.   BBT is a way to avoid problems, no different than car or homeowner's insurance. And, spoiler alert, they auto-renew, too.   BBCC offers no-interest on any purchase of consequence and earns them rewards on any other purchase. If they're gonna spend more than $100 in a year in Best Buy, they'll get more for their money with a card than without.   That's it. You educate. They make a decision. And, no matter their decision, you don't own their consequences. They do.",kcv745w

The store manager is not allowed to speak with a potential employer. They must direct them to HR and more often than not the employer isn‚Äôt going to go that far. If the manager does speak to the employer and gives you a bad review you can report them. Best thing to do since you do need to use it on a resume is list Best Buy with your dates of employment and use corporate address and phone number.,kcwq5gl
"Usually just confirm work dates, possible reveal if they‚Äôre eligible for rehire",kcwmzuv
"It depends who the future employer calls. HR will give them dates of employment and if you're eligible for rehire or not. If they call the store then store level management may or may not tell them more.  &#x200B;  I know for a fact that my old GM told another employer about a former employee having attendance issues. The former employee used me as a reference and the first thing that the person who called me asked about was if he was late or didn't show up for work. HR wouldn't have told him that, and neither would the guy applying.",kcwrcvc
"If you don't give notice, they can absolutely tell your potential new employer. Even if you live somewhere with protections against them ""shit talking you"" they can still say that they wouldn't re-hire you, which is basically the same thing.",kcx1bpg
"Depending on where OP is, this is not at all accurate. Even if they're not allowed to go into further detail, the majority of places are allowed to say whether they'd rehire the employee.   It's a workaround to that exact system. Corporate will also have access to the ""do not rehire"" note on an employees file.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",kcx1s4o
"And when they laugh at the question and say ""no way"" that sends a pretty clear message.",kcx1jpq
If you think you will want to use your current manager or a specific coworker as a reference you might want to put in the two week notice to not burn any bridges. Otherwise I'm pretty sure you can just say you are done as they can't force you to work.,kcx3upp
"Managers can‚Äôt directly talk to a place asking for a reference, it would go to HR (or should, I‚Äôve seen people get in trouble for not following this) And they are only allowed to answer certain questions only.

"Let Go Today; I was informed today that I was being terminated due to attendance violations. (Being late, not calling out or no call no showing). It‚Äôs been quite the experience over the last 20 months. The people I‚Äôve worked with, especially in product flow are some of the funniest, most hard-working people I‚Äôve ever known, and I was honored and privileged to work alongside them.   With that being said, Best Buy, as a corporation, is completely and utterly fucked. Starting at the top, Cori Berri is one of the worst executives I‚Äôve ever heard of. She constantly takes this company and drives it into the ground. It almost seems intentional at this point. She is a fucking idiot and I wouldn‚Äôt trust her to run a lemonade stand, let alone a huge corporation.   To one of my managers in particular, you are an asshole. Plain and simple. You constantly call people out over the walkie for stupid things, knowing damn well that it could‚Äôve been a 1on1 conversation, or one that didn‚Äôt need to occur in the first place. Instead, you sit on your ass or stand at the AP and belittle people. Idgaf how long you‚Äôve worked there, you‚Äôre a dick and I hope you eat shit. You constantly bring morale down throughout the store and then wonder why people don‚Äôt have good attitudes.  To the managers, STOP INTERRUPTING CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN SALES FLOOR AND CUSTOMERS. It has to be the most deflating thing in the world when you‚Äôre having a good conversation with a customer, selling them product, learning about them and their interests, and then hearing over the walkie, ‚Äúoo (salesperson‚Äôs name), looks like a good membership opportunity‚Äù. I hear that and I can feel the balloon being deflated. Fuck your stupid memberships, fuck your stupid credit cards, 99% of customers don‚Äôt want it and you make the interactions worse by shoving it down their throats.   With that, Best Buy needs to bring back specialization. One of the biggest complaints that customers have is that ‚Äúyour sales floor doesn‚Äôt know shit about the product.‚Äù Well, how could they? Best Buy wants sales floor to be experts on thousands of products. You know what happens when you try to be an expert on everything? You‚Äôre an expert on nothing. It‚Äôs simply impossible. Best Buy is trying so hard to suck customer‚Äôs dicks and",18ttsxk
"It‚Äôs simply impossible. Best Buy is trying so hard to suck customer‚Äôs dicks and yet, is actively pushing them away every single day.   All in all, I‚Äôm predicting that Best Buy will not make it to 2030. I hope I‚Äôm wrong because workers at Best Buy need jobs.

It‚Äôs also a middle finger to coworkers stuck handling shit without you while you‚Äôre taking your time to get there.  BBY isn‚Äôt going away anytime soon.

Counterfeit Bill detection; Why isn‚Äôt Best Buy able to use the counterfeit pens to detect bills or the black lights anymore (black lights are still able to be used in mobile though???)‚Ä¶Even in SOP says we aren‚Äôt supposed to use them. That is so weird to me.,18tbjcs
Counterfeit pens aren't reliable.,kfcz1wa
Pretty sure in mobile it‚Äôs usually used to check that identification cards are legit since they usually have something on them that glows under a black light. The iodine pens together with checking security strips ought to be enough.. but yeah SOP is against those for some reason.,kfcwyem
"Real answer if you care is that the pens don't work on common counterfeits. The pens detect if the bill is made of paper or fibers that's it.  Common counterfeits bleach small denoms and print large on the bill, like bleach a $5 and print $100 on it.  Counterfeit pen will show as real. Gotta hold up to the light and check watermark, look for reflective ink on the number, also real bills you can feel ridges on the jacket of the portrait.  There's a few features that are so hard to counterfeit no ones putting that much effort into fake bills to pass at best buy. So keep checking large bills, especially if someone's trying to buy a candy bar with a $100 or buying a MacBook and no rewards.",kfdmqmq
"Because someone might be offended, and people's precious little f****** feelings are more important than what the Best Buy makes money or an employee keeps their job.",kfcvt04
Lol it's against SOP yet you can still buy them on iProcurement,kfcyc0s
There are many ways to detect a counterfeit bill. The newer $100 bill are harder to counterfeit but not impossible. The blue strip down the middle is made strong enough that you can‚Äôt rip the blue strip down the middle. Had someone come in with an almost perfect looking $100 with the blue strip. I tried ripping and it did. Turns out he perfectly glued the blue strip onto it. It had the hologram and everything.,kffk31z
If you can‚Äôt look at a bill and tell it‚Äôs counterfeit you likely shouldn‚Äôt be handling money. Even if they bleed out $1 and print a pre 1990 $100 or $20 you should look for the water mark or ribbon.,kfdw35z
"My guess is they don‚Äôt want to piss off customers mainly, but also the money they would spend on replacing those pens and lights would add up(let‚Äôs face it they will get lost or rundown at some point)",kfeuppx
I have heard from numerous people who work at banks that the counterfeit pins can be defeated by spraying spray starch on a bill.,kff1w3e
Neither is not checking at all ü§£,kfdi24s
Well you would ASSUME people are smart enough to be able to detect that but people also aren‚Äôt that smart.,kfcyvi4
Who gives a f if someone uses a pen to detect a bill if you‚Äôre not doing anything wrong it shouldn‚Äôt matter. But I could see this being the case üòÇ,kfcz0ch
Right?! Because that makes sense üòÇ,kfcyng2
A $1 bill won't have a ribbon.,kff2hka
The big issue is most counterfeit bills are bleached fiber.  The pen won't catch that.  It only catches the counterfeit money made from paper.,kff2dtl
"You'd think so! Most changes we make are due to customers being, well entitled customers. Not all customers are, but you know.",kfdb29g

"Grocery stores are not less chaotic lmao, maybe more straight forward but the target near me is waaaaay busier than my Best Buy",kfdlqzd
trust me I‚Äôve been there. Most managers there are horrible. They would sometimes deny my legally mandated breaks and would get mad at u if you went over your 5th. also if it‚Äôs not busy they send you home early even if you‚Äôve only been there for 2 hours. Constantly understaffed and overworked and you‚Äôre expected to deliver. on busy weekends you might be there til 1 am and they expect you to come back at 8 am which is highly illegal. If you notice they mostly hire high schoolers cuz they don‚Äôt know the law,kf7slkt

Validation; Within the last two months I‚Äôve been the validation person for brown goods and i‚Äôve had two instances where we were sent too many of something and shorted on other things.

"It's normal. Don't stress about it. As long as you're scanning all the items needed, the IAs from the validation will be automatically sent to the RDC. Plus the swat in your store can see it and confirm it. So you're not forced to deal with the issues alone. They're your backup. As for the RDC I believe the form is now automatic for any variance that you find. Before it was your responsibility to submit it.   Just be accurate, don't worry about speed or the timeframe.",kf7p4f7
"Check what skus you are supposed to be receiving on the products‚Äô batch labels or maybe if the store number matches yours.

"Did I get laid off?; So I‚Äôm sure this is gonna sound obvious as hell when I talk about this more in length, but I would like a second opinion on this. So I believe that the managers at my store were bringing other seasonals into the back office to let them know whether or not they were keeping them. I wasn‚Äôt one of these seasonals, however, I worked a short shift the day they started doing this. To add on to the confusion (at least from my end), I‚Äôm not scheduled for next week at all. I figure the proof is in the pudding there, but I also can‚Äôt decide if they laid me off or if they‚Äôre just waiting to talk to me before putting me on the schedule. Either way, I texted one of my managers about it and I‚Äôm already looking for other jobs here, so it doesn‚Äôt bother me.",18sf67d
"Drastically lowered hours are par for the course after holidays. If you were laid off, they'd have to actually tell you. Maybe they will, but it's just as likely they simply don't have the hours to allocate for you on the next schedule. Definitely look for other jobs to get your bills paid of course, we all gotta do what we gotta do.",kf7juof
"Same boat as you, not scheduled next week at all, only got 10hrs thus week",kf73i9y
"I started a job in May last year, what I didn‚Äôt know was they cut hours after Christmas ( big box building material store) we got 1-2 days a week until spring when planting season was back. Some full time people changed their store position until Spring and then went back to their regular positions. We were working a lot over Summer, I‚Äôm part time doing full time hours. This year they didn‚Äôt hire any seasonal workers for the Summer or Christmas, we actually lost several people but they did not replace anyone. So this year I‚Äôve had a ton of extra work and think it will remain the same after Christmas til Spring with just a few hours cut. We all want a more consistent schedule so I guess this is how they are trying to keep their regular team and still give us consistent hours after the holiday rush. Most places hire seasonal employee to help during the busy times and when the sales start to drop they let them go again, if you‚Äôre really good, want a job and they have an open position they may offer to hire you as a regular employee otherwise they don‚Äôt need that extra help and a lot of seasonal people don‚Äôt need that extra money .",kf8at94

Selling memberships; So I‚Äôm a seasonal but I want to continue working at my current Best Buy I love tech and I love the management team especially the GM he‚Äôs a real good and funny guy. So I‚Äôm ok product flow but I‚Äôm also trained on checkout and I have good amount of pics. But I‚Äôm trying to make the store gain more profit so I was on register and chasing people out and trying to get them to get Plus or total. So far I sold about 8 I think in a month. (I only work 2 days a week and was on register for about 2 weeks). What are some ways I can make them get the plus or even total anyone got tips?,18rr59a
"try to lead people to products that are on member deals, if they want something that isn't on member pricing i just slow down and explain plus to them, no point pushing total unless they get multiple products that need coverage or you're in pcs. i always add that if they shop with member pricing in mind they will make their 50 dollars back",kf5fgq3
"Honestly, most people I talk to don‚Äôt even know there‚Äôs a membership. I usually open with ‚Äúhey, have you heard about the Best Buy Membership before?‚Äù And I just go hard on the three main benefits of Plus. Try that and get your 30 second pitch down to the nail. Don‚Äôt forget to use your phone to show them the deals and ask them if they‚Äôre upgrading their laptop or if someone in their family will. If they ever hit you with a ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt buy here a lot,‚Äù still tell them that the Plus membership is perfect for them because with one purchase they can make their money back. Or tell them that that is the reason why they created that membership. Practice that and try to make your pitch as short as possible since people at checkout tend to just want to leave fast. I hope this helps.",kf6s0mw
"Don‚Äôt pitch it as an option and pitch total like this ‚Äú were you interested in getting any warranties on these products today it cover‚Ä¶ (overwhelm them with information fast) and then tell them how much the warranty is and then say for example, if the warranty is $150 say for just $30 more dollars you can get all your future products coved In this also don‚Äôt tell them it‚Äôs a reoccurring charge until they‚Äôre ready to swipe the card because by that point they already have your mind made up that they want it also if the warranty is over $179 don‚Äôt even tell them their other options",kf6rkvb
"When Wall Street looks at Best Buy‚Äôs financial picture, they look at sales, sales to last year and profit bottom line in addition to a few other things they do not look to see how many memberships Billy Bob sold last year to determine stability of a company.",kfbt3s5
"For appliances, you can sometimes get a bundle deal with the memberships. And don't forget total includes the protection plans for two years as long as they keep the membership active. They also get access to member exclusive pricing occasionally and early access to deals. They also get a 60 day return window",kf4sske

Back room fulfillment SOP?; Does anyone know where to find the SOP stating pics and packs are considered fulfilled once staged? Or is it just once the pic is completed? I‚Äôve been trying to find it in SOP but can‚Äôt find an answer.,18rpavt
"Can't find it right this second, however pick time starts from the moment it is in the pick list, to the moment it's staged.  This does not apply to any picks prior to opening. However if the opening picks are still in the list AT time of the store opening to the public, they have the full time applied from the moment it populated to the moment it was staged. So a N/A pick becomes a 2 hour pick. In general as long as it's below 60 minutes, you're fine. If any leader tells you it's 30 or less, then they're making it up for the sake of metrics.   Edit: this time of year the whole idea of 1 hour or less is a joke. Realistically it won't happen. Unless your store is in perfect condition and everything is 100 put away or put back where it all belongs, is received right, planoed right and 0 customers moving stuff around....if you get it under 1 hour, sure. Go nuts. If it's over 1 hour, its not the end of the world. Only thing it hurts is the managers egos and their scorecards.",kf2lrtn
Store pickups : from drop until STAGED is considered the entire fulfillment process. That's why there needs to be a sense of urgency prioritizing SPU > SFS.,kf2m3vg

"A lot of the internet attorneys on here need to give up their ‚Äúlicenses‚Äù to practice internet law.   There are plenty of credible resources regarding employment and HIPPA on the internet. Especially where the info is specific to doctor‚Äôs excuses. Go to those resources instead of these faceless, credential lacking, unregulated internet lawyers for your guidance.  I‚Äôll suggest looking at the sites of law firms that specialize in employment law and sick leave rights. When those attorneys say ‚ÄúThe HIPAA privacy rule states that an employer may request a doctor‚Äôs note from an employee, but only if it is necessary for an acceptable reason, like sick leave, Workers‚Äô Compensation, or health insurance.‚Äù, it tells you that responses suggesting  employers can‚Äôt require a doctors excuse are wrong. It could possibly still be contrary to a company‚Äôs internal policy, but that still doesn‚Äôt make it illegal.  In my place of employment, the doctor‚Äôs excuses need only read that ‚ÄúMr. Smith was seen in my office for illness or treatment and can return to work on this date with or without these restrictions‚Äù. If there are no restrictions, you‚Äôre allowed back to work. If there are restrictions, if the job you do can accommodate those restrictions, then you can come back to work. If we cannot accommodate those restrictions,  you can‚Äôt return to work until those restrictions are lifted. Which also means a return to the doctor to provide the statement saying no restrictions. And that only means time off with pay if you have the PTO to burn. If you don‚Äôt, you are off in an unpaid status. And in all of this, we obtain no information that violates HIPPA.  One thing to note is that if you don‚Äôt have the PTO and you aren‚Äôt in a protected status such as FMLA, you can be terminated for excessive absences. The loss of  a minimum wage job in a job rich environment may not be a big deal to a lot of people, but job history and a previous employer saying nothing more than ‚Äúineligible for rehire‚Äù may impact your ability to replace that job or to get a position that is actually a well paying job down the road.  And who came up with or approved  these policies? Attorneys licensed to practice law in our State. Not some yahoo practicing internet law.",kfeexbm

How about we direct the ones who call screaming and cursing us out straight to you so you can handle that for 8 hours straight.

I'm sure you can handle it so much better.  Or better yet can see through it when the customer claims we  told them something is in stock and shows up for it when we actually told them it isn't/it has go be ordered but they think if they show up and scream loud enough one will magically show up on the shelf/back warehouse.

Finally you are active status in the system. 5. Then you get put on the schedule and you have to reset your password. You will probably have to call support because they will forget to give you access to something after you return.  What you probably did was  1. Told your boss to put you on the schedule, so they did. 2. You worked one day and they got in trouble because you weren't made active in the system yet. 3. You are still locked out because you are still on leave. 4. You boss is clueless and no one has advised that you need to contact HR and Sedgwick.

"Thief incident; So the other day I was working on the floor in the closing hour ( plz keep in mind thieves, or as we call them ‚ÄúVIP‚Äôs‚Äù are very common at our store) especially during closing hour As I was making my last laps around the store making sure we were customer clear I hear a call on the radio saying we have a suspicious customer who has multiple videos games in his hand and is in a blind spot of the camera  They asked that somebody go over there and see whats going on I was by the area so I walked right over  I see the guy stuffing the video games up his shirt and he was facing the wall so I walked around so he did not see me approaching and I crept up being me and just said ‚Äúexcuse me sir?‚Äù He turned around and his heart dropped I asked him to give me what he took and he insisted he didn‚Äôt take anything  After asking him a few time I asked he lift up his shirt cause that‚Äôs where he was putting the games he was hessitant and would only pull his shirt halfway up he also had a waist trainer on for some reasonüíÄ he pulled his shirt up finally to where I could see his stomach but I seen the game case poking out so I told him give it to me  He gave me 3 Nintendo switch games and I also took the other 4 Xbox games he had to the side  It was peaceful for the most part he gave them to me I told him get out of here let‚Äôs go  Now as I‚Äôm walking he was  in front of me about 5 feet I‚Äôm just walking behind him telling people on the radio what‚Äôs goin on And as we‚Äôre walking he tried to reach for his gun but it slipped out of his pants and fell right in front of me  At 1st I thought it was another game but when it landed in front of my foot I knew exactly what that was  I backed up immediately and put my hands up for a split second  He instantly grabs it and says your good your good I just point to the door and tell him to leave He concealed the gun again and proceeded to leave  Looking back on it this was kinda scary considering the gun was pointing right at me in the floor and the outcome could have been very different this happens a few days ago still is something so crazy I never thought he would be armed     I have the video of it but idk if I should post itüò≠",18z296s

"The selling of a Best Buy Plus or Total Membership is really that big of a deal?; I work on a national call center phone line, and for me, it is very worrying that the team of workforce tries to push the Best Buy Plus and Total Memberships as often as they can. I need to vent a bit about this...  Like, seriously. My management team wants me to offer the membership in ALL the calls, even the ones for transactions where the customer is only interested in getting X cheap product (like just a CD Player or some headphones ledser than $ 100).  Even when the customer already told us they don't plan on getting a service! Just the product.  My manager is still pushing me a lot, I think he is also lying to me because I am still offering the membership in the majority of my calls (the only chances where I don't is where the customer already closes the phone on me before I start telling them about it ü§£ without interrupting him)...and he is not seeing my effort!!! ü•µü•µüò§üò§üòÆ‚Äçüí®üòÆ‚Äçüí® Like, if the Membership is a Holy Grail or something I need to sell every week when realistically, I only get like 1 per month, and that's usually when the customer ALREADY desires the Membership, without me talking about it ~first.~  EDIT: My supervisor is also threatening me with giving me some DA or disciplinary actions if I don't get a membership sale soon enough, or if I don't offer the membership in the 100% of my calls, as stated earlier, I cannot ALWAYS offer it because customers often start speaking first after my opening, and some of them also fade away after I mention the membership. I think that threat is just some form of emotional manipulation b*llshit. I mean, in the rest of the shift he seems like a good guy, but I'm pretty sure some of the rest other coworkers who are under my umbrella might think that this behavior may be too much, specially one of them that is a veteran in the same Call Center company and was pushed one time to keep offering the membership after he made an initial sale for other one.

Perform to a level, that manager struggles to even find fault in my performance.   Taking care of client best as possible, and figuring out solutions.  Dont care about metrics at all.   You be never wrong in this situation.  If it fits in clients life, or it something they can benefit from.  It is not my decision if something is right for the client, i let them decide.  I dont know their daily life, and finances.  It is not my position to judge/ or question.   In other words, just think of credit card/tech support.  Like required ""Welcome/Greeting"" that needs to be fit somewhere in a conversation, you said your piece, and you move on.   &#x200B;  Also, figure out what works for you, not what manager tells you, most managers never held position of people below them, all they care about metrics at end of the month, to make them look good.

The memberships are what the company is focusing on to generate revenue.  People that have the membership are more likely to shop more at bestbuy. As a sales person your job is to sell memberships.

I think what the biggest issue is is that you go from basically giving free services in home to anyone with a membership to now essentially asking them to pay full price for everything instead. The pendulum swung to the complete opposite end of things.

I think with my actual experience, the best moment in which I can get this membership into the conversation it is as soon as possible (so QA can listen into it), just before sending my cart/invoice, and at the end of the call, OR if the customer mentions something related to the benefits like a return and exchange/having a device broke in the past (this is for the total geek support) without me explaining it first.

It's kinda like the razor and blades sales model. If we get the the membership (which theoretically makes little to no money) then we will sell more stuff that does i.e. cables and what not.   Personally I think bestbuy went in to deep.  With how little the staffing is at stores the customer experience is kinda poor. It makes sense that we want to offer it to everyone because even if someone isn't purchasing something today they might still be interested in signing up.

Unless the agents personally use the software themselves in their personal time.  Most agents wont know how to use every specialized software.  Its like asking the guy who makes paint, to paint a picture.   We can do training for computers, proper use, internet safety tips, general questions about Microsoft Office 365, etc etc.  (General Knowledge)   Now, if agent has a idea what program, or software client wants to use.  Some of us will on our personal time, do self training, before meeting the client.  But also some of our agents do come from different backgrounds and they all walk different paths in life, so they have different specializations.   But in alot of cases, if you setup in home appointment, with expectations  that we going to teach client about specific software they purchased, or for in store training (please make sure you note it).

"I finally quit.; I should‚Äôve listened to what others on this subreddit told me when I posted a post about me getting hired. (But I learned my own way so hey, it is what it is). I did LOVE the job at first‚Ä¶but then I learned REAL QUICK; The company is a joke and so was nearly my entire team. Especially ‚Äúleadership‚Äù. The whole entire store was even filled with drama and power hungry shift leads too. They didn‚Äôt take a situation seriously that was ‚Äúoutside of work‚Äù which ended up inside of work. (As I worked with all parties involved in said situation) A whole situation (that I DID NOT start) blown out of proportion (& lied about) and didn‚Äôt even want to hear my side (the right side) of it. So the the person who created the problem lied, sucked everyone‚Äôs dick, and was near to get me fired because of the horrible things she said about me AND someone else. So, I quit the same day they pulled me in the SDR and ‚Äútalked‚Äù to me ‚Äúabout it‚Äù when really it was only about numbers and corporate talk instead of trying to find a solution. I even brought up how the situation was affecting my work and slightly my mental health and they basically dismissed and disregarded it. Looks like you have to kiss ass and suck dick to even be seen/heard/promoted/ whatever. And I‚Äôm NOT that kind of person. They switch so fast to whoever is doing the best on the board. I USED to be top of the top but it had dropped, then I wasn‚Äôt their favorite anymore and I was treated like ‚Äúthe rest of them‚Äù. All the coaching they ever gave me was just complaining about not getting members and apps, but not finding a solution to help me with that either. FUCK BEST BUY! LMFAO Also if you were wondering my ‚Äúposition(s)‚Äù I was the Certified Mobility Apple Pro Advisor & Wellness Ambassador. Never got a raise and never got full time. Complete fucking joke.    (Also the notice above was written the same night after I got off of work that day they pulled me into the SDR room after the ‚Äútalk‚Äù.

However, at some point, my mental health became more and more fragile due to the disconnect between the stores, clients and us field agents. We kept walking into clients homes with incorrect work orders that were missing SKUs which led to client dissatisfaction at times. Add in my hours being cut and you have more stress added in.   I will say the things I learned here helped me to move onto a career that I have wanted for a while now. The install experience was a bonus but the customer facing skills helped me a ton.

Floating holidays; I've read the email and I'm wondering how the floating holidays gives us more time off?

"If you‚Äôre full time and you work on those holidays you‚Äôll still get the time and a half. What‚Äôs changing is you now have the option to use the 8 hours that they automatically give us on that day ( so for Labor Day you‚Äôd get the time and a half PLUS the 8 hours-this is how it‚Äôs always been). Or you can keep that 8 hours in your bank and use it for a different paid day off. I believe there will be separate banks for the time. So one will be PTO, pers holiday, sick, etc",kht5u97

Is one better than the other in terms of workload/stress? What are the pros and cons of working geek squad vs. sales floor?",198k8di
"Workload is much higher, and stress will be high at first. It usually takes a good 3 months before you feel comfortable with every interaction. Instead of selling, you'll have to take appointments, take walkups, sending, receiving, func checks, and help the ARAs. On the sales floor, you see people when they are excited to buy something new. At Geek Squad, you see people when they have problems. If you are a problem solver and love challenges, Geek Squad is fun. If you make the choice to switch over, may I welcome you to our ranks.",ki7ux3l
Do it. Sales is a dead end,ki7wz5v
"I think its hard to list all the pros and cons tbh since a lot of them can be shared. What I can say is GS has a bit of a harder time when it comes to interactions. People are coming in specifically because something doesn't work and they can't fix it. Unlike coming in and buying a new TV after 10+ years. For this reason there are more upset client's whether you're telling them their manufacturer warranty doesn't cover their 1000$ laptops broken screen, or telling your turn time is 5+ days (unsure of your precincts turn time just an example), or telling then it can take 1-3 weeks for service center repairs. I've had to tell people their cherished memories of loved ones that have passed away are gone because data recovery wasn't successful/possible. What I can say is GS for the most part was the most exciting and loved position I had at BB. There were some terrible times and experiences but the positive and fun outweighed it. I was a top performer as a sales associate (million dollar writer it was called at the time). I left sales and went into GS and spent 7 years as CA/Sr/ARA/GSM. I loved my time with GS and even in those really shitty moments, there were so much good/fun memories I had. I personally say go for it, no longer with the company but from what I have heard sales is a dead end and far more miserable. I've been out of BB for awhile now and unsure how it is now on the floor/Precinct. Maybe some current employees can share specifics around current conditions. Lol",ki7zp0c

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I don‚Äôt encourage lazy customers like the ones who ask ‚Äúwhere is computers‚Äù to every employee on the way through the store ignoring all signs or if the employee is currently with a customer.   But I do think Curbside is a competitive option that pretty much all retailers need to offer, it doesnt require almost any customer services at all, and there are likely customers who would not shop at BestBuy if it was not an option.   You have several demographics that use it often; Sick, Lazy, Don‚Äôt want to look ‚Äúready‚Äù, ‚Äúits too cold outside‚Äù, or Want it today but don‚Äôt want to go into a store.   I am sure there are many more, but these are people who may not order from Bestbuy if the option wasn‚Äôt there. With Price Match getting worse and harder to actually secure and less options than Amazon, Bestbuy HAS to be competitive in the brick and mortar options, and this is totally expected by some customers at this point.",ki6o4vc

"We didn‚Äôt really raise a group of people to be like that, look at the demographic of people who do store pick up, it‚Äôs not mostly people who have been ‚Äúraised‚Äù recently.   It doesn‚Äôt cost jobs to reduce the time customers spend in store, it‚Äôs costs job for them to stop making the in store experience any good.   People didn‚Äôt stop going into bestbuy because curbside became and option, prior to curbside there was store pickup customers, who notoriously didn‚Äôt spend money in store anyways, so they just added to the queue in store and took in store resources at customer service, moving a portion of that to curbside which doesn‚Äôt need someone trained in customer services and returns (CS staff means that the store can borrow from warehouse or other non-customer roles).  The biggest loss of jobs was removing decent training for the Sales rolls, reducing staff in record profit years, and choosing profit over staffing. BestBuy was a much better shopping experience 3+ years ago and I don‚Äôt think they are going anywhere super soon but they aren‚Äôt trying to cater to  instore sales anymore, just think of the displays in your store that haven‚Äôt been updated for years or don‚Äôt work, and how many people you have working at once.  I also think the clientele for bestbuy went downhill with Covid, but don‚Äôt blame the customers for corporate mistakes, and definitely don‚Äôt blame curbside pickup for loses in employees, it secures sales that may not exist otherwise and sales is where the money to pay employees comes from. Blame corporate for greediness.",ki7ytmk
"I‚Äôll have you know that my marketplace director likes to open the store with 1 member of leadership and 1 associate (me) and while doing curbside I am also responsible and executing the following tasks: Merch, Picks, Front end, Sales.  I respect and appreciate Bestbuy for allowing us to do more with less and I willingly work exactly 31 hours a week to avoid getting full time benefits because I refuse to dig into the p&l of my store.

This is a warning to blue shirts who apply to GS thinking that we sit on our butts all day. ü•≥,ki7xlls
TL;DR Waaaaahhhhhhhh,ki4jr60
"Ehh I can see them upset at us because we have a more efficient precinct than many I've seen. Our function checks are always between 0-5 as we do them the moment they come through. I know when a customer is buying something or not, and many times I'll function check small stuff while they are blabbing their story. Average around 2 totals a day usually on top of that. If a customer is going on too long I let them know we gotta end it there for the 20 min consult. Our ARAs prefer to call clients. Etc. This results in us having SO MUCH free time while still making more labor than we spent (we are positive labor for a while now and even donating our hours). We also do not help code 1's because corporate told our managers we are not to do that. (Our managers were making us do customer service ALWAYS, and so we emailed HR and forwarded our managers asking about it. HR replied and told us that customer service and front lanes are NOT in geek squads job responsibilities. Because of that they refuse to even call us for code 1's. Always remember if you are being taken advantage of, make a paper trail and ask hr if it's allowed. The moment they say no, your store will back off entirely.) So many times we are found doing nothing in the back being lazy and having fun :) but every store member knows they can come to us for anything, we often will buddy up and help our store associates sell a total by them bringing their client to us to ""techy explain"" some technology or benefits. We never turn that down. But if we did all our job responsibilities, I'm sorry we aren't responsible for doing things outside our job description and we wont. Just as it's not blue shirts fault we are understaffed often. It goes higher.",ki7tu2u

"Left Best Buy After Six Years; Some Tips and Advice for those Employed.; 1. Work hard, but not too hard. If you‚Äôre trying to get promoted within your store then personal performance matters, but it doesn‚Äôt in the eyes of corporate. Being likeable by others is often more important than your numbers when it comes to promotions.  2. Your experience in retail will vastly be determined by the managers at the store. If you don‚Äôt like your management, look for another store in the area and switch over. The extra 10 minute drive is worth not hating your life every single day you clock in.  3. There is no job security in retail. The position you‚Äôre working now will most likely not exist in another year or two. If you can‚Äôt constantly adapt to new roles, stores, and responsibilities, then retail isn‚Äôt for you. (This isn‚Äôt exclusive to BBY)  4. Don‚Äôt be afraid to apply for positions you don‚Äôt feel qualified for. I got a work-from-home corporate position after being in retail for a long time with no degree; again, you need to be likeable by others.  5. Steer clear of post-military employees, specifically those in management roles. They take their jobs way too fucking seriously and you don‚Äôt get paid enough for that bullshit. This isn‚Äôt the Marines, it‚Äôs Best Buy for Christ‚Äôs sake.  6. Stand up for yourself. I see too many people get walked over by others at this job.  7. Don‚Äôt fuck with the installers; be nice to them. Leave notes on your orders. The installers are your best friends if you take care of them, I‚Äôve had many go back to job sites and clean up some of my mistakes on orders. They‚Äôll save you from many angry customers.  8. Don‚Äôt fuck with the Geek Squad employees either. See above point for reference.   9. HR doesn‚Äôt mess around. In 99% of cases it‚Äôs so much easier for them to fire someone. If you actually use the HR hotline as you should, you will see someone lose their job (provided you have a valid case).  10. You may see your position as a career, but corporate does not. The reality is that 99% of retail positions have high turnover rates, and corporate treats them this way.  11. The current sales model is extremely broken and a far cry from what it used to be at Best",199f5h8
"The current sales model is extremely broken and a far cry from what it used to be at Best Buy. You are making less money than previously and it‚Äôs 100% intentional.  12.

I should have stated it differently since I feel like my post came off too harsh in that part. I have nothing wrong with prior military members or those that get a job at BBY after their military career.   I just see a lot of post-military guys become managers and enforce hyper-disciplinary practices to employees which seems excessive given the fact that it‚Äôs usually just a bunch of college kids.,kiee496
"Health Plans coverage declined; Anyone else notice our Health plans went even more to shit? Although our premuims went up.. especailly regarding the prescription coverage through optum rx where I seen nothing about the change said in the enrollment period material this year when signing up! So a month before the new goes into effect I got a letter telling me they will no longer cover one of my name brand prescriptions I am on bc there is a generic (when they have for the past 10 years and so on) Come to find out now following that and going with the lesser one of that I am now forced to pay $100 vs the $34 that I was previously paying for the NAME BRAND now getting the generic! Sounds like a load of crap! Well done best buy, well done! You seem to disappoint with your employee benefits and compensation and screw your employees one way or another once again! Hardly could get a .20c raise last year after working here for 12+ years, no matter how well I perform bc its a blanketed system where it doesn't matter how someone's performance is, during the height of inflation but then now also want me to pay more in my health care premuims every 2 weeks on my check and now $66 more dollars for just my one prescription each time! Not sounding much like its truly a raise at all to me..",199vtyn
"Insurance companies are a massive scam. We need single payer health insurance. We can afford it massively. Just cut less than 10 percent of military spending and use that for Universal Healthcare like every other major developed civilized nation in the world. Canada takes better care of their citizens than this joke country, the ‚ÄúUnited‚Äù States of America.",kih5zm5
this is such a nuanced complaint,kigv4xi
"Hey I got a similar notice about one of my medications, and I called the insurance to find out what could be done. They were able to look into it and approve a 90-day supply instead of the 30 day, and this lowered the increase in cost and actually ended up being cheaper than getting 3 30-day supplies separately each month.The person I spoke to wasn't able to provide a reason why it worked out that way, so I have no idea why the insurance did this, but I was relieved regardless. If you haven't yet, try calling the insurance to work it out and see if there are other options available.   Ultimately Best Buy doesn't control what the insurance companies approve, or the cost of that insurance. They only control which insurance type they offer. The decisions for pricing are at the insurance companies discretion and can't be blamed on Best Buy.",kigyjta
They 100% control how much it costs. They negotiate premiums and coverage and quite frankly can provide any version of cost from free to nothing based on what level of costs they are willing to absorb. This process usually begins about 6 months before open enrollment‚Ä¶  FYI‚Ä¶the goal isn‚Äôt to improve your costs or coverage. It‚Äôs to deflect increases by limiting quality of care and coverage and increasing your costs.,kih621t
Well thats great it worked out that way for you! This was already on the 90 day as I changed it that way to the mail in pharmacy through them to save money last year. They will no longer cover the same name brand medication at all no matter if its 30 or 90 day. And that is definitely something best buy negotiated or agreed to as for the lesser coverage in the terms for this year..,kih9kp5
The goal is to stay as close to industry minimums so benefits do not become a siding factor in retention while providing the least benefits possible. There is an equation designed around employee options at a middle management position down. Their goal employee is No Family / Male / Under 30 / No Education.  This is the cheapest employee to provide benefits to.  All hiring starts here and there are entire algorithms and social conditioning in place to get as many as possible in this demographic in all retail and hospitality,kih6yhl
Exactly! They definitely negotiate the premuims and terms of coverage for the insurance they offer..,kih8yzk
"Sorry, I didn't phrase what I said well. I meant they don't control the cost of the medication, copays, doctor visits, services etc. The cost of the plan and type of coverage offered, yes absolutely. But the individual costs within that plan are not under their control, as the insurance company determines that and can change it at any time.",kiheyrd
"I would still try calling and seeing what options there are, if you haven't already. It's also worth discussing with your doctor, as they should advocate on your behalf or know if there are other brands of that medication which may be covered for a lesser cost. I hope you're able to find a solution.",kihfg8q
"Considering a job at Best Buy; Exactly what the title says. Be brutally honest please. Ups , downs, pay, benefits, health insurance. (I have a few health issues so I need some pretty decent one) What working there is like in a whole. Is it worth it?",19cja6q
"It‚Äôs retail. The managers will push you to sell as much shit to people as you can, with special extra emphasis on memberships they probably don‚Äôt need or want, or credit card sign-ups.  Expect to have to do this with every single interaction. Expect your managers to be lenient at first but after a while you‚Äôll start to face accountability if you can‚Äôt sell memberships, Geek Squad Protection Plans, or get people to sign up for a credit card (which does count as a hard credit check and might affect their credit scores).  Pay is every two weeks on Fridays typically. The major federal holidays are recognized as company holidays, with a few exceptions. Health insurance used to be pretty good. United Healthcare or Blue Cross Blue Shield in most places plus a new one I think they just started offering. Tuition assistance and a few other nifty programs for certain people.  The employee discount is okay. It used to be significantly better. Your hours will likely be dictated. Y your performance. If you‚Äôre able to hit all your sales goals and metrics, you‚Äôll get plenty of hours most likely.  Your days off are typically not the same every week, and they‚Äôre usually not back to back. You know, typical retail bullshit.  It‚Äôs good sales experience for other jobs in sales, like insurance and what have you.  It‚Äôs a decent job compared to working at a shithole like Walmart, that‚Äôs for sure.",kiz9g9j
"I would run in the opposite direction for sure I worked there for 15 years it was a fantastic job then, now they could not  pay me enough to stay there. All the tenured employees are leaving as fast as they can, your hours will depend on you selling all the crap that‚Äôs listed above and the MANAGERS suck from high above and it it trickles down",kj172z7
"It‚Äôs a good place to work, been there 4 months as seasonal and being brought on permanently. Just hustle around and try to learn about the tech you‚Äôre selling while helping customers. Training by department is effectively dead (at least in the stores I know of), but  coworkers are really helpful if you have questions, and customers are generally patient if you need to research something on your phone. On the floor customer service is practically non-existent on retail these days so people are usually grateful if you take the time to help.",kizh24x
"If you're a very competitive person then go for it, because you're gonna have to compete for your position. Every month, there's a leaderboard where you can see how much stuff you sold basically, and the ones on the top are the ones who get the most hours and bonuses, like me for example. I love my job, I'm still in highschool and the pay is pretty good. My managers and coworkers are the best and always lighten up my day, but of course, if you're going to be a bad sales advisor, then the managers might treat you slightly differently, but like I said, it's only up to you if you want to compete for your success or not.",kj1o4jt

You do understand that other virus and sickness killed more people than covid .let's be Frank if we want talk about not participating in COVID correctly then why is multiple doctors and multiple analysts are coming out and calling the pandemic of overreactions ?  90% of the people that passed away from covid of being in poor health is that simple they didn't take care of their body therefore their body could not fight off the virus just like any other disease or flu out there . Covid was nothing. I did not even receive a covid shot and never got covid until I went back to work and worked right beside someone Who had this shot and I still got COVID and I recovered from it it was like a bad flu but here's the thing I take care of myself and other people in my home do too.  the people that don't take care of themselves or more likely going to be sicker if not dead because of their ignorance of shoving f****** junk food down their throat all the time and not taking care of they're body stop. trying to gatekeep someone or gaslight someone Over something so over exaggerated. covid did nothing but inform us from us that people are That people are stupid and sheep   People that trust the government and media are SHEEP,kixavxa

"Taxed on employee discount after returning?; I am an employee at Best Buy, I‚Äôve recently moved into a new apartment and have bought ~20 products in the last couple of months. Some products did not fit correctly or I simply decided I did not need them so I returned some, bought other sizes‚Ä¶etc. I ALWAYS get GSP on anything I buy, as employees know, that gets discounted by a large amount. so my question is: do those items that I returned still get taxed on my paycheck as ‚Äúimputed income - employee discount‚Äù?",19bepp6

I don't like to push something on people who don't want it, but they kinda force it.   I'm just here to ask what it's like to work in the warehouse? What are the things that you have to do, and how easy/hard are these things?  Thanks in advance :)",19eyno5

"Warehouse job is trash. You‚Äôll be all the over the store while everyone else stands around doing nothing. They call you for simple tasks they can do themselves.

"In my 5 years with BBY and observing coworkers, whenever someone moves from sales advisor to product flow/warehouse, they never transfer back to sales and I assume they like/prefer the ‚Äúwarehouse‚Äù job functions and duties. I have also seen one and only one warehouse employee (who was a newer employee) unloading pallets off the truck SOLO- so regardless of scheduling/call outs/ weather & holiday issues/ that truck still needs to be unloaded and becomes your responsibility to get it done and unloaded. Depending on floor coverage, I have seen advisors enlisted to help but it‚Äôs not often nor is it ‚Äútheir‚Äù responsibility to get it done- it‚Äôs yours, lol again it really depends on your stores leadership and management style- to know how good/bad your store‚Äôs warehouse is functioning.   Then the next move from warehouse/product flow is to Geek Squad delivery/install. These positions (at least in our store) rarely open up but that could be also another option for you. We also have a 2 bay auto install area, where depending on your location, you might be able to look into that.",kji2xof

On top of that it was a full 8 hour shift, and I blame myself for wanting more hours.   Now I'm debating whether to show up the next day and I have a morning shift. But I might sleep in.

"Rejected but given a job offer?; I recently applied to a GeekSquad position and they took their sweet time to get back to me, around 26 days, they sent me an email saying they decided to reject me but that they have a position that would better suit me.   That position being the same job I applied to but at a different location. Has this happened to anyone before? I submitted the application and I got the same standard emails for virtual interviews but then they said that they appreciate me submitting the interview even though I didn't submit anything for the second application.

I‚Äôve worked with many people; most good, honest, and hard working.   I tried working in an office for two years while being O/S and I hated it. I thought that the nature of the work was a net positive for the world. I learned quickly that the grass isn‚Äôt always greener, it‚Äôs just a matter of how well you maintain it. I came back and switched roles again. Felt like I was home.  I started at the bottom as a part time home business group sales associate. I know the anxiety of only having 12 hours on my schedule. The resentment towards others receiving preferential treatment. The realization that life isn‚Äôt fair and that sometimes you come up short. All these lessons hurt but I still learned a lot about not only myself but how the business works.   Best Buy is a company that‚Äôs being ruined from the top down, but it‚Äôs provided a lot for me and my family. I have two good cars and time off to enjoy working on them. I can see my family and friends regularly. I wouldn‚Äôt have graduated college without this job, nor would I ever be in a place where I felt I could finally become a father.   I don‚Äôt know how much longer this company has. It can be ten years or ten months. But it gave me an education and a hell of a resume.

It depends on your personal circumstances.  If your store has a well being ambassador you could get with them.,kka1jbt

"Please explain ""erosion"" and why Bestbuy finds it profitable to walk real business in a post COVID era....; Help me understand",1agxnno
"Erosion is a very broad spectrum that comes from a lot of different places. Internal and external factors come into play for a lot of it. I won‚Äôt go into specifics on it because I‚Äôm sure you know about theft, inventory issues, bad returns/exchanges etc.. as for the walking business aspect. From my understanding the company prides itself on giving the customer you are with a 10/10 experience while providing a complete solution for them. If you can build that trust and relationship with your customer then you will gaining a potential long term or life long customer who will shop more often and spend more money. Unfortunately that means you walk a lot of other customers due to not having product or long wait times. The company stands by their commitment that they would rather walk many more potential customers if it means the ones that are in front of us are taken care of. Which in retrospect, if we don‚Äôt forcibly change the customers way of thinking and how to shop then it won‚Äôt even matter. The plan is move all that to instore/in home consultant and designers who can give that experience and build a package and everyone else needs to order online for store pickup. The stores will become just show rooms with minimal grab and go product on display. (Think Apple Store or carrier phone store). This will reduce a lot of retail operating costs and make up for all the erosion that you speak of. Best Buy is going to become a cross between a vendor show room with demos and an Amazon fulfillment type center for item pickup. Probably geek squad services too.",kok7l0n
"So erosion in the sense of geography would be the earth eroding away over time from different circumstances: rain, floods, wind, etc. Now imagine a big pile of cash, like a mountain of cash that Corie sits on top of. Erosion in business is all the things that wash away that big pile of cash: theft, shrink, damage write offs, price overrides. We can‚Äôt keep her mountain of money big without building dams to stop the erosion.",kokwk4g
Store credits; Current employee wondering how do we order more of the store credits. We are currently low at my location and will probably have to borrow some from a Best Buy close to us in the meantime. Do we get them through iprocurement or are they GNFR?

"There's a SKU for them, I don't have it offhand but you just need to look it up in RSS and have your SWAT key it to 0.  They have a value of $0 in the system so this causes no shrink, but once keyed to 0 it automatically orders more to come in on your next shuttle.  If your low but not out you can check the SKU just by scanning one of the credits UPC.  At least, to my knowledge that's the only way to get more.  They're kinda weird that way.",kojnpoq

"Delivery Issue Am I going to get my tv?; So, I bought an open box tv about a week ago and the worker sales guy was super nice and helpful.  So nice that when I got home I decided to send an email to corporate about how nice he was.  I pull up my receipt and I realize that he set it up for delivery for some random other person at some random other address.  At first, I thought this might be an honest mistake, but I googled the guy it was being delivered to and all his mugshots came up.  So I figured my sales guy was receiving kickbacks.  I call Best Buy and I tell them what happened and ask them to correct the delivery address.  They say sure and the correct address shows up on my account.    Yesterday I check my account as it‚Äôs supposed to be delivered today and they have cancelled my delivery.  I reschedule the delivery, but now I‚Äôm wondering if this was all a scam and I‚Äôm never getting my tv.  Should I just get my money back and buy it elsewhere or will they actually deliver it someday.",1ahw8bb
If they canceled your order you aren't getting the TV but if you made the order in store you should go in and process your refund. It's a 112 order in store.,koqhxjf

"Assuming the TV hasn‚Äôt already been delivered to the wrong address, you can go into the store and explain the situation. Just let them know that the order was placed under the wrong profile and was not double checked at time of purchase. If they need proof of purchase as it‚Äôs under a different address or profile the name on the credit card and last 4 numbers will be on the bottom of the receipt. Order number will be listed under the TV on the receipt as well  You can also cancel the order and re order but if the TV was on a sale price then it might not be the same price now.",koqqcxl

I reached top 10 in my territory and you absolutely do not need to lie to get memberships. There's so many easy ways to show people it's absolutely worth every penny. You just have to be aware about what a customer actually cares about. Plus has easily been my favorite because it's essentially the best value IMO. Total is great too! I recommend thinking critically about each individual membership benefit and really understanding just how much value is being left on the table. Most customers will listen to you especially when they are making a heavy purchase of $500+ dollars. Especially if it means they can save ANY money at all.,koz7rxv

BBY Helpdesk followed by Scam Call; So I had to call the bby helpdesk to submit a ticket for a computer issue last week. Of course when I call it goes right to our overseas team. They get all my information and I get the IT ticket submitted. Well 10 mins after that call I get a scam call from someone stating they are from IT and have noticed a hacker on one of my devices (obviously a bullshit scam attempt). But it makes me think that these overseas teams that we have are turning around and selling ours and customers information to these scam companies to make up for how little they are getting paid.  Has anyone else ran into this or something similar??,1ajzzan
"Nothing like that when I‚Äôve called the helpdesk, but I have had an older couple come in one time and tell me that they reached out to 1800GS for help. After spending some time on the phone troubleshooting their computer, they were transferred to another person that scammed them out of $500 using the same method that we usually see in clients emails all of the time; the fake Geek Squad membership.   I fully believe that our third party call centers also run these scams in their off time or at least share an office space with those that do.",kp4s4mg
"There‚Äôs been a few investigations into these types of tactics. This has been going on with the Comcast overseas customer support for a long while. The people will take the customer calls and give the customers information to someone else who they work with, which leads with a follow up scam call.

Everyone in my district has always been really supportive. And I think sometime last year they started offering pronouns on your name tags. The company overall at least puts up a good front of being welcoming to all, and if you get a good store it can be a great environment.

"Mostly informational. I don't push it, I let people know and advise when there is a benefit they might get from it.",kq3f2pm
Because in geek squad you are selling them the membership for the benefits to apply to something that they have already invested in. On the sales floor you are not only trying to convince them to buy the product but also trying to convince them that the membership benefits that product. Most people sell out of their own pockets instead of just knowing the benefits and applying them to the client using active listening.,kq3z9yc

But using all the PTO for the year, to fill in the gaps, to actually get full time hours, isn‚Äôt worth it?

P.Ms and Apps; My numbers the past 2 months have actually been awful. (6 pms and 1 app last month and 6 pms and 2 apps so far this month) I am still technically on the seasonal schedule so i dont have that many hours. Im guessing my pitches are flawed and ive tried all the pitches ive been trained but im wondering if anyone has any actual tips.,1aucdoj
"Do yourself a favor, don't.  It's not worth it and no matter how well you do one month they will want more the next.    As a seasonal, keep doing what you are, when they ask what is wrong say you don't feel confident or trained on how to support certain customers.  This will force the EMs hand to help you. If the supervisor isn't capable of helping move to them and tell them on your own accord you want to be better and to meet goals.  If you are reliable, on time, and focused they have no excuse but to keep scheduling you.   But seriously go anywhere else.",kr30b0b
"Honestly the thing that helped me the most was being knowledgeable and transparent about how the membership works. Mentioning that you can get a full refund if you don't like it within 60 days helps a lot, as well as mentioning how easy it is to cancel both the membership and the auto renew. As far as perks, the main thing to mention is 60 day returns and price adjusting, giving an example helps a lot. Don't push Total at all unless they plan on using geek squad services or buy an absurd amount of electronics for the 2 year warranties.   But yea, like medical tailor says, unless you plan on staying here long, don't kill yourself trying to be an amazing sales person with no commission. My numbers are really good and I still get bitched at even though the metrics chart has me near the top in at least 80% of all categories.",kr31skp
How‚Äôs your product knowledge? In any sales environment being confident in what you‚Äôre selling plays such a huge part. You can message me if you want some help.,kr3gtq0
"Team up with geek squad often for packages and educating client in tech and protection.  It helps a lot, we are your friends!   Ill have someone from sales floor first mention protection and then they'll bring them over to us. Or for apps many times customer wants a high end pc but needs that little push or education on a computer to get that app. We get no metric for apps so we can help with that.  Totals arent as important for us either but they still count, not as much as for sales floor but if we really help then we split the total. If not you can have it fully.   Use us often too! Lets say you're in computers and client is asking about upgrading their current laptop to a new one. Let them know we can set up their device for them! Ask them if their data is important to them because we can also transfer all that data from the old device to the new one. Client is looking for something a bit more powerful or more storage but doesn't want the highest end model? Ok mention them we can upgrade their storage or ram in many models to customize what they want. And whats this? All that is covered under Total. Oh and guess what even more, they can use that credit card they just got on it :).",kr58sso
"Ive gone to all the EMs and supervisors and theyve been helpful and understanding saying that ill get there at some point. I always show up and cover call outs on short notice, from what ive heard they want to keep me for the long run which i dont mind. I love working there just the pressure with PMs and apps is insane if it werent for that i would absolutely love it",kr311rj
"I actually rarely get customers on plus almost all my computer transactions end in a total, i get applauded for that, my apps is the real struggle i try to lead with the 10% back on the first day (it insane how people pass up on $1000 purchases)",kr32aso
"It‚Äôs growing gradually, computers is what im strongest in and i get the most totals out of there. Theyre doing well training and coaching me throughout the entire store",kr3gyfc
"Them saying they want you in the long run is big, but they can't promise since it's mostly out of their hands based on head count.",kr31dq3
So you're seasonal?  They might be forced to let you go regardless of performance due to what corporate says.,kr318h3
"Plus can be an easy Segway for someone who doesn‚Äôt want total. ‚ÄúHey you still get this member pricing and 60 day return policy‚Äù. Prices go up and down all the time, leverage that for the customer and tell them as soon as it goes down in price come in and we will price patch for you. A lot of it too is the member pricing, look for computers that have a member price or one that isn‚Äôt on sale, yes a lot of customers don‚Äôt see the value in plus because we as employees don‚Äôt see that value in plus, make it make sense for them.   For apps, find the objection tbh. If you‚Äôre struggling it‚Äôs pitch, price, or product. Either they don‚Äôt like the pitch, they don‚Äôt believe the monized value is enough, or they don‚Äôt believe in credit cards. For the 10% back option find out how they are paying, if they are paying in debit, tell them we can pay it today and give you x amount of money in rewards. They only thing you can do is offer and eventually you will get the results you want. Ultimately with you being seasonal this is still good work don‚Äôt feel discouraged that you don‚Äôt have the ‚Äúprime numbers‚Äù feel great that you are willing to ask for help and want to get better :)",kr36g71
Because fun fact $100 back from opening a credit card is a terrible introduction amount most places give you 50 or 100 (150 for Amazon visa) for literally just opening the card no purchase required imo not worth it for a hard credit check unless they plan on shopping with bestbuy often. Financing is what most people are interested in at least in my area. At a 31.99% interest rate it's a terrible card for people who aren't responsible if I didn't want the financing I would take my hard credit inquiry elsewhere. üòÜ,kr4xf9i

It does because they want to keep that performance or higher as that might be the end of the leaders.,kr31ube
"Just keep doing what you're doing.  Convince the customer to see the benefits and speak to the values of rewards and financing when pointing out the cost, just don't be obvious about it.  When the customer asks a question about financing or price, explain the financing offers.  Tell them that they can break it down if they'd like over xyz months so they can afford an upgrade in what they get.  Or if it's too small, $30 in rewards is still good as hell on $300",kr31pqv
I mean when i get a shift longer than 5 hours i can easily punch out 11k in revenue,kr323ht
"Then you have decent options, and those numbers should be doubled at least.",kr326y0
Not sure what the total revenue of the store is considering its an insanely small store and a not super busy town. But ive been told many times ive made a third or half the stores revenue that day i think my best in the few months ive been there was 40k in one 10 hour shift,kr32kdz

BP AND TT; Do your leads or managers take BPS or TTS?! I‚Äôm a sales person and when a Spanish speaker comes the manager takes the BP From me. Is it valid? Are they able to do that?! I‚Äôm low on bps because I barely work. But he takes them. He gets paid $18+ while I‚Äôm barely making $16. Idk this is just a rant,1au73g1
"Leaders in my store typically give BPs and TTs to other employees. That being said some store judge leaders on these metrics more than mine does.  Personally, I think the person translating should get the credit (or choice of who gets credit) since they're the ones doing the work of communicating with the client.",kr2346u
"In the field, GS Agents are being pushed to sell My Best Buy Total and Plus memberships as much as possible; and considering the vast majority of their clientele is used to getting computer services for free with their $200/year subscription certainly makes it a very difficult sell. ‚ÄúOh hey, you know how for years you haven‚Äôt had to pay me to come out and do stuff for your computer, we‚Äôll, now we take $180 of your money per year and in return you get 20 percent off of each task we do in-home!

TV Box in Dumpster?; I am moving and looking for a tv box. Will I find this in a BestBuy dumpster/Recycling?,1atz9sc
No they tear them apart and the compacter crushes it. Besides bestbuy has been locking their dumpster for over a decade due to dumpster divers.,kr0jc4t
If you can catch a geek squad installer in the morning or late afternoon they might have boxes before the clean out the vans. Stores never have them as they are always broken down,kr0w429
It gets bailed and thrown into a compactor so unfortunately no.,kr0n5xu
Go to Home Depot and buy a fucking TV box.,kr0uui6
"Nope, they get placed into a cardboard bailer and crushed. You won't get one unfortunately.",kr0ttix
"You can buy boxes to move things like tvs, pictures, mirrors etc from home depot or lowes.¬† They arent cheap, but theyre cheaper than smashing your tv while moving.",kr1pibf
Not sure on the sales floor side but at Geek Squad we have to keep all boxes even damaged one for packing things like Open Box items and service items. But you might get lucky and find a beaten up box outside. Odds are you won't find something perfect,kr0jemj
"None of the trash or cardboard is accessible from outside the building, all is compacted",kr0uf6d
Use bubble wrap and plastic wrap,kr105h7
"Go to the back of the store before 8 a.m. and there will be a Geek Squad van that comes around to unload garbage and recycling. Kindly approach the employees who aren‚Äôt awake and ready to deal with people yet, and ask them if they have a good TV box in the size you‚Äôd like. Then give them a good tip for doing something nice for you. Gift cards for food places is also accepted.",kr2ju3w
No. Best use doesn't actually use dumpsters. We have a trash compactor and a cardboard bailer. The dumpster that you see outside is required depending on where the store is located. These dumpsters are not for trash or electronics they are for standard recycling. Best buy locks these because people will throw trash in them which bestbuy can be fined for,kr30aql

"Scheduling Complaint; Nothing technically illegal, but I'm currently the only full time being made to work six days straight and when I brought it up just keep getting told it's cuz of staffing, so it's that bs thing where they combine two partial pay weeks together and make one huge pay week and then given only a single day off.  At this point store leadership isn't listening to me what would be the next step?   It'd be one thing if it was everyone but it's just me so I feel targeted. At minimum it feels unfair. The other FTs also get every weekend off where I'm forced to work nearly every Sunday at minimum.  I'm just so over it and honestly wouldn't be surprised if it results in retaliation at this point. I just want a stable and fair schedule.",1atycal
"If it's within the guidelines and local laws. Without any proof besides ""i feel like.."" ""feels unfair"" won't really get you anywhere. Does it suck, yeah. But beyond talking to your GM about it that's probably all you got.",kr0e3ba

So it sounds like you are getting the same total amount of days but you don't like that you don't get the same days each week.,kr1pjop
"what does your 14-day schedule look like? there has to be some other off time other than the 'single day off' that you are claiming. i understand grouping the thurs-tues thing meaning 6 days together, but there are 8 other days unaccounted for there that you're not mentioning",kr3mo5x
"You're not explaining your schedule very well. Write it out.      But, in general, Go forward on your schedule, and request unpaid time off to break up the days they are having you work (This means you're still willing to work a 40 hour that week, but just need the day off)... And put DOCTOR in the reason line.      If they ask, just say it's personal and would not like to talk about it.",kr1n23l
"I would recommend picking 2 weekdays and changing your availability to having them off. Yes, you will have to work weekends but your 2 days off will be back to back ie Tuesday and Wednesday (or whatever 2 you choose) and will only have to work 5 days in a row. This works at our store.",kr1uuq8
I have 8 days coming up. And I‚Äôm 74. Suck it up.,kr0j273
"You get a weekend day off? Must be nice!  In reality though, I‚Äôve had a Sunday Monday off, then had to work Tuesday - Saturday (5days) then the following work week had to work Sunday - Thursday (5days) so essentially a 10 day stretch, no overtime. I mentioned how I needed a day off in between THE TEN DAYS and basically got scolded and told no.   Welcome to BestBuy.",kr15xf4
"After covid when they laid of 80 percent of the stores my store started scheduling people Tuesday - Saturday one week and then the following week Sunday-Thursday, so we would work 10 days in a row, and I had requested several times for them to stop doing that and theyd get so upset with me that i was complaining. They told me that that was my schedule, and if i called off, i would get written up.",kr2ap9e

I'd like to understand how all the other full timers get weekend off? I'm a vpl and I can't paroled from a weekend off. Do you not have any vpl's in your store?,kr51z3x
Not sure if I buy the 'hr won't do anything' thing. I've seen them reverse a managers decision to fire someone because that manager didn't like that person.,kr52pqg
"I mean I'm only part-time and scheduled only one day a week for 4-5 hours so, be lucky you got more! But I don't blame you for how you feel.",kr5e27p
"What sucks is they have me working 48 consecutive labor hours but I am not getting overtime compensation for the extra 8hrs because it doesn't show that way on paper and then only getting a single day off, and the other FTs literally don't get that schedule and weekends off. So far there's no proof either that my schedule is required that way and why business needs necessitate MY schedule to be that way.  Honestly just sounds like this is going to end up escalating to HR. If at least to prove a point that I am unhappy and not being heard.",kr0j3py
"My gripe is that they fuse 3 days at the end of the week with 3 days at the beginning of the next week making it 6 days and a total amount of 48 consecutive hours and being the only one scheduled that way for seemingly no reason other than 'staffing'. I don't understand why it's necessary for me to be the only one to work when the others never seem to have to.  I would be perfectly fine if we were all being scheduled that way once in awhile or alternating weeks like that but it's only me, so I'm frustrated. I feel like I am being cheated out of what should technically be 8hrs of OT but it's a legal loophole so there's technically nothing illegal about it.",kr1y97l
"While this is possibly a solution, they don‚Äôt have to grant schedule off requests either, unfortunately.",kr25388
You might be content with rolling over and taking it. I am not.,kr0j8jc
Aww look the boomer likes being abused!,kr0sf36
This is actually an insane statement,kr1y2k6
Your store would've hated me since I need schedule accommodations due to mental health lmfao,kr2rx5f
Anything that is over 40 hours in a week is OT. If you work Saturday-Thursday it wouldn't be OT even though it's 6 day steaight.,kr2qt8v
"HR isn't going to do shit for you because there's nothing wrong being done here. You are welcome to request changes from your leadership, and so long as they are within the appropriate guidelines they can decline your request. If you can't or don't want to work the hours they're offering you I'd suggest looking for a new job. It socks, I get it, but this is kinda what you sign up for working in retail.",kr0mh9k
"But you‚Äôre working 5 days in each week, not 6 days in each week. You are entitled to not like the fact that you worked 6 days in a row, but you‚Äôre not being cheated out of overtime.

Walmart buying Vizio; So I just read that Walmart is buying Vizio. Do you think that means Vizio will become a WM exclusive or do you think BB will still continue to sell them. Just curious more than anything,1avjz5g

"Bay Closures; Has anyone heard any whispers about bays closing? I've been worried since last November about ours. Our busy season last fiscal year had us booked out at least a month in advance while these last few months we've been booked out at MOST 8 or 9 days during our supposed busy season. At one point I was pulling shifts as a CA up at the precinct because labor was so short, now they're pulling labor from the precinct so I can still work my hours doing what I enjoy in my designated position. The problem now is our precinct is running into a labor shortage as well and I feel as if management will probably start cutting us down to 1 CA and 1 ARA at any given time.  Technically our bay is supposed to have a part time and a full time tech, but was changed years before I was moved to autotech and we have 2 full time. My thoughts are by the end of summer they will either drop my position to part time or kill it entirely since it's no longer sustainable because we aren't generating enough labor to pay for it, or close our bay entirely and expand our warehouse. The only thing keeping our bay afloat now is the fact that we're the only open bay for quite a long distance and NOT booked out a month.",1awjt9k

I think this it bullshit; In my micro market (6 stores) they want/expect product flow to sell and push memberships. I have no problem trying to help customers to the best of my knowledge.

I say this not as a ‚Äúyou‚Äôre supposed to be doing front lanes‚Äù but more of if you are being asked to do anything outside of what that detail report says, you should partner with management and show them the report.

They always got pissed when any leader would say anything and other employees were, rightfully, complaining because they had to take up their slack. You may not even realize you‚Äôre doing anything wrong, but you are and it‚Äôs unfair to your coworkers. I‚Äôm sure you see enough of each other when you‚Äôre not on the clock so, just stay away from each other, there‚Äôs no good reason for you to be around each other.

"I‚Äôll probably get downvoted for this but this is my honest opinion and experience. I met my current bf when we were both working at Best Buy. I was originally a CA and he was a VPL(AT&T). He would get his ass reamed when he would come into the back of the precinct to ‚Äúask a question‚Äù (aka flirt with me before we started dating) and his ass was rightfully reamed. There‚Äôs not really a reason VPLs should be behind the precinct. HOWEVER I moved positions to become full time and became a VPL (TMO). At this point we were not dating but eventually spending every shift together 8 hrs a day/ 5 days a week became the beginning of our relationship. We set CLEAR BOUNDARIES to continue to do our work without making it weird or obnoxious. Our managers knew and I even suggested getting us put on opposite schedules so we weren‚Äôt being shown any favoritism. You‚Äôre allowed to love who you love but PROFESSIONALISM is key regardless if it‚Äôs just Best Buy. Your EM needs to piss off if he‚Äôs doing it for no reason but I‚Äôve also been in his position and seen couples that can‚Äôt stay away and employees complain. Set your drinks in the break room and give her space. Your em is most likely getting pressure from employees management and the GM to get the distractions under control.

"Tell your GM in person, email them, and if the behavior continues, call the open and honest hotline",kruc4i9
Hate to break it to you but working with your girlfriend is viewed as a conflict and you'll have to go above and beyond to not mix business with pleasure if you want it to work. I've had multiple relationships at best buy and I got talked to any single time I was hanging with her even if just for a minute. The other employees will cry how they can't hang with their friends but you get to go talk to your girlfriend. I know it sucks and I'm not saying it's fair but life isn't fair and this is corporate America. They will see your relationship as a conflict and they like to eliminate conflicts. There's not really much you can do about this situation because HR is almost definitely going to take the managers side especially in this situation.,krv7ll3
Don‚Äôt bring it up to the GM or HR.  You will literally be fired with a couple months for ‚Äúunrelated reasons‚Äù.  Same with you girl.,krvdqzk
"Sorry that your EM is such a jerk. In our store, we are all everywhere in the store.

This is very good advice. In my experience it's the same. Being in a relationship at work you have to go out of your way to show that there will be no issues. You are viewed as a conflict of interes tand corporations like to eliminate as many conflicts as they can.,krvsjrw

Just go to work, do your job, trust that your s.o. will be there when it‚Äôs time for you both to leave and spend as much time together as you want sharing a drink on your own time. I also forgot to mention in my original comment that we‚Äôve had several sets of siblings over the years always up each other‚Äôs butts making excuses as to why they needed to be together chatting and then whining that they were getting picked on all the time.

"They didn't interact with each other.  He took a sip of a drink.  Did you even read what they wrote?  Sure, maybe they are lying and OP and their girlfriend actually had butt sex up front.        Normally though, you just answer the question based on the facts provided, and maybe throw in a little ""Of course, there are two sides to every story.  This advice only applies if what you said is accurate"", or something similar.  Why does he have to buy his own drink, and why are you so insistent on this point?  Why can't any two employees decide to share a drink, if that is their choice?  If you think OP walking up to the front to get that sip is an issue, would it be alleviated by forcing all employees to keep all drinks in the break room?  I mean, they'll just be walking to a different space.  What if OP's girlfriend happens to be in the break room at the same time?  This story is basically, ""I walked up front for all of a couple of minutes to grab a sip of a drink.""  It doesn't really matter who the drink belonged to, OP had permission to take a sip from it.  If the only problem is him being at front lanes... then that restriction should apply to everyone.  Not just those who have a girlfriend working front lanes.  What the fuck was the EM doing at front lanes? Shouldn't they have been at the door greeting people and watching the camera to remind you to pitch Total, while you were in the middle of doing so?

"Sometimes the ""job you're getting paid to do"", requires that you interact with other employees.  I can't count the number of times me and a CA were talking about a client issue, and some manager comes along and reminds us that there is a customer at the counter.  The one we were discussing.  Then, when that is explained to them, they always find some other bullshit to complain about.  Never mind that every other leader in the building had been singing our praises regarding all of our metrics.  Nah, they just got humbled so they have to make a big deal about the one piece of trash on the counter or whatever other piddly bullshit they can come up with on the fly.  I do the job I'm paid to do.  I do it well.  I am paid well above cap for my position.  I've been with the company for 11 years now.  I'm also 45 years old.  I don't need anyone micromanaging who I speak to.  Maybe they should do *their* job and offer training, advice and guidance, instead of just walking around with a report they didn't even generate and reading it to us.  Anyone in the building, hell the guy who empties our trash and cleans the bathrooms, can read a report and tell everyone how much they suck.  The most complicated thing they have to do is tell a customer no.  Which we all have to do several times a day.",krv07ks
Apple Seed Program; Hey did anyone hear that for the people that did not get the iPhone 15 Pros they are possibly sending out MacBook Airs? I know initially they said iPads but hey a MacBook is even better.  The apple rep in my store said he heard that somewhere.,1b0e9rc

Well I know right now they only sent out the phones. And for people who didn‚Äôt want the phones they stated they were going to send out iPads at a later date. But then our Apple Vendor mentioned MacBooks and we both were surprised.   Which I got the phone but I couldn‚Äôt use it because it came carrier locked. Actually I ended up getting 2. I think the came from a store that burnt them.  That silly because the google sweepstakes was a contest and the Apple phone is an accommodation technically. But that is crazy.,ks7e567

Waste of time talking about the same thing every week.   Would love for upper management to visit stores to show us how to do everything with little hours and help.

This is incorrect. Severance plan under HR clearly states your base hourly rate multiplied by 20 hours as part timer (40 for full timer) multiplied by eligible number of weeks based on your tenure.  It's 2 weeks of base pay for each year of service. Minimum number of weeks is 6 and maximum number of weeks is 26.,ksswreu

"Flex pay & Wage groups are broken for ARAs; Im an ARA and i've been with the company coming up on 7 years, 3 of those with GS. In an effort to meander my way into more responsibility, I became our stores first shift lead back when the program went national and I did it to be able to help out my team, grow my skills, and overcome obstacles that not having access to certain systems presented. Great, except theres one glaring issue: Im an ARA and the shift lead program was clearly never intended to have ARAs become shift lead capable.  For an advisor or CA in wage group 10, the bump to base pay WG40 when scheduled as a lead makes sense, it may not be a big bump depending on how close they are to cap, but generally you still make something going from WG10 to WG40. The issue is that the flex pay program for shift leads automatically puts you at the base rate of WG40, even if you're someone like myself who makes more than that. What does that mean? It means that when I get scheduled as a lead, I actually take a pay cut of $1.22 despite going from WG30 to WG40 because im approaching cap. Because of this, its not been sensible for me to be scheduled as a lead for going on a year now, but because I don't mind the extra work I'm used as a floating lead essentially whenever I work.  You would think I would put my foot down and be angry that I get no additional compensation for the extra work (part of me is), but to be honest most of what I do and have access to just make my job and my precincts job easier so I look over it (IE: Schedule making, overrides, NOVA admin, back office/superuser, procurement/ariba, DBT - but NOT powerBI since you have to be scheduled as a lead once every 7 days for powerBI to populate data).  Being said, even though i've basically accepted the extra responsibility, it still doesn't cover up the fact that the flex pay program and wage group system is broken when it comes to ARAs or anyone outside of WG10 as a whole.",1b5aepu
"Talk to your leaders. An ARA can be scheduled in a different department and keep their pay if the ""activity"" is still Entitlement. The department determines what labor bucket your hours are from and the activity determines pay. The job part doesn't seem to matter. It will require your leaders or whoever makes your schedule to approve the alert in TLC when putting Entitlement with any department that's not BoP but it works.",kt5epwt
This is the reason I declined becoming an official shift lead when the program rolled out. Was told I couldn‚Äôt get a pay diff because I made more in my current role as a senior. Pissed off the ASM and GM. Now I cover the floor for 4 hours a week and get told I should come to sales on a daily basis,kt6ppp5
"I go from $22 to $16.37 if they don't make sure I'm under WG30.   Have had to have multiple pay checks adjusted because someone who wasn't trained to write schedules wrote schedules and inadvertently took about $250 off my pay.   No worries best buy. I'm not paycheck to paycheck or anything. What's $250 between family, right?",kt6g6kd
This has been a thing since they first introduced flex pay. They stopped it for a while because most people flexed down on pay while they revamped it. As an ARA you technically can‚Äôt be a SL because of this issue. Your pay grade is higher than the advisors and would have the issue of flexing down like you‚Äôre experiencing.,kt4n4bl
"Thats not entirely true unfortunately. While its true that the labor comes in the form of leadership, BOP, FOP, etc, and the activity can be virtually whatever they would like, the job is what determines your pay, such as sales generalist WG10, Consultation WG10, precinct repair WG30, and the three shift leads (Employee, Process and customer) WG40.   Changing the job from WG30 to WG10 for example, as in an ARA being scheduled to work as a CA, changes your wages for that job from your primary pay to a ""pay-by-job"" rate. If you go down a WG, such as going WG30 down to WG10, then you get the highest pay available for WG10, but if you go up a WG such as WG30 to WG40 then you go to the lowest pay of that WG even if your normal pay is higher. The only reason im confident in saying this is because we experimented with this several months back and discovered that both scenarios (going up to WG40 and down to WG10) do exactly as I outlined.  In principle that should still be fine since you should be able to just keep the job as the default, while changing department to leadership and activity to leadership which then just flags the mix as bad and you just manually approve it, however market and corporate HR are cracking down on this and telling stores to stop doing this since it completely negates the flex pay and pay-by-job system.",kt8xjdt
(Happy Cake Day!)  This is the same issue that our Sr has run into but for a while they were overusing him on the floor and he couldnt do anything to help out in the precinct. It wasn't until our SEM stepped in that our GM relented and let him actually do precinct work rather than act as his pawn.,kt8yykr
"Be wary about this, several market HR teams and now corporate HR are cracking down on this because these adjustments essentially defeat the purpose of their wage group, flex-pay and pay-by-job programs. Our team has already been told to stop mixing ""incorrect"" jobs and departments as a work-around because they know they have to pay us more.",kt8yo4y
If you remember when they first release flex pay they had it for a plethora of jobs like connected car mobile appliances etc but too many issues,kt4npsj
"And therein lies the rub: it means that officially, ARAs can't skill up like advisors can. The equivalent for us would be if CIA was a non-permanent role like leads but since its not it means on paper we have no avenue. Again, I've personally accepted this simply because im treated as a defacto lead/mini-sup anyways, but it effectively leaves no mobility or opportunity for ARAs. I get that as a non-exempt job grade 8 we are looked at as a sort of lead for job grade 3/4 advisors vs 9 cia and 10-11 sups, but in practice job grades do little for ability and access.",kt8ycf1
"Good call. My bad, I had it backwards. The job needs to be ARA and the activity is what doesn't matter. ‚úå",ktar3ek
100% agree and I think the CIA position is nice for that upward mobility but it‚Äôs a single spot unlike advisor where it‚Äôs not a position but extra tasks they can do,kt90u9c

I‚Äôve worked here for about a year and I‚Äôve heard all of these as well. Typically our Experience manager or supervisors. I‚Äôm in the mid west.

"- Bumper to bumper warranty - It‚Äôs a replacement plan - discounting services  - it‚Äôll be done same day if you buy the membership   Just today had to put feedback in on a blue shirt who told a customer to go get their tablet that had GSP so we could exchange it. They were pissed when they found out I was not going to ‚Äújust return‚Äù their 9 year olds 600 dollar tablet and that I had to send it for repair.   The only thing I don‚Äôt have an issue with is: Why is there a deductible or why did I get billed again.   If you‚Äôre an adult who blindly clicks buttons during a transaction without reading things you deserve getting bent over. I always poke fun at these people.   ‚ÄúYou agreed to it at time of purchase, should you have chosen not to read the prompt on the pin pad we cannot be held responsible.‚Äù  I always go out of my way to let people know if service fees and terms of the agreement and even tell the customer things are subject to change as Best Buy sees fit.   The other thing that gets me is people trying to convince one time shoppers that Best Buy protection is better than GSP.   GSP exists if the company goes under monthly Best Buy protection does not. GSP is a monetary claim limit backed by a third party Best Buy protection is not.",ktedjtx
Please report these to the open and honest hotline if you witness it being done in your store. Nothing can be done if it isn't reported.  Best Buy doesn't want to get into any legal trouble and will take it seriously,ktej6nx

The sad part is leadership recognizing them as ""all star sales"" in our store and micro market.  They could do anything illegal in our store, leadership would look the other way.",kte3gqu

"It is REALLY necessary to have a Best Buy Total Membership to have access to the Geek Squad Tech Support and other services, or not?; Title.  I remember the other day having one of my supervisors recommend me, to speak with my customers, guide them through a funnel-like series of questions. At the end, if the customer said he doesn't have a My BestBuy Total Membership, he NEEDS one to receive some tech support (like repair, guidance on how to setup a computer or making a data transfer from a phone to the other, etc).  And from that day, I felt something was not right. On the official [Geek Squad History](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/geek-squad/history-of-geek-squad/pcmcat1494529157815.c?id=pcmcat1494529157815&intl=nosplash) Website under BestBuy is written..and I quote: *""No matter where you bought it (the tech appliances), Geek Squad can help with your tech and appliance products. We have Agents available 24/7 by phone or through online chat, and at any Best Buy store"".*  So this also includes products NOT BOUGHT with a My BestBuy Total Membership active...  So. Who is right in this case? Should I believe my manager or the website? What would be the differences between a tech support service from a chat with the Geek Squad Agent to a customer without any memberships, to a customer that have the Total Membership?  I need to know because this is bugging me from a while ago and I need some answers. I do not want to ask other supervisors in my store because I don't want him engaged in a fight or conflict because of this...",1b7r86h
"The difference is going to be the pricing. Yes, someone without a membership can still get support, but they're going to pay out of pocket for every single instance and it adds up quickly. I had a client not too long ago who, when I took a look at his profile, had spent over $300 worth in multiple online support sessions in the last year... when he could have paid $179 and had unlimited access to 24/7 tech support for the year instead.   For in-store services, a tuneup/malware removal service alone costs $150. Most clients who come to us needing us to scan their laptop for viruses are people who ""need"" Geek Squad, so it makes more sense for them to get Total for $30 extra and have the freedom to connect to 24/7 support or bring their device back to the store at any point during their membership instead of paying $150 or more for us to help them one time.",ktkntp8
What it says on the website is right but it doesn‚Äôt mean that repair or data services are free. Consults are free but anything beyond that requires payment. That‚Äôs how it‚Äôs always been and how businesses run. Customers have the option to pay for each service a la carte or have most of them included in a yearly membership.,ktks9pv
Just don't do anything for free. Try to find a solution that helps the client but helps revenue in some way,ktkhtmf
