What do Best Buy employees think fo the company?,"Move on and look for something better. Or hang in there till you actually find something. Yes, the pay is decent but you can do better based on your experience. Plus best buy looks good as a stepping stone for your resume. Don't think it gets better because it won't. Maybe 6 years ago it was better, but the new version and direction isn't worth the stress. Look around you, if the seasoned staff and veterans are leaving it should be a clear indicator that it's a lost cause. Don't let best buy burn you out or change you as a person for the sake of sales goals.  Best Buy has 0 concern about employee retention. Just credit card apps,TTS and NPS. All factors that affect achievers and leadership bonuses. Not the individuals doing the work. You do everything and get nothing while the leaders get everything.

What are the most common reasons for employees to leave Best Buy?,"Well, I worked there for 4 years. 3 of being in the highest ranked sales position in the company (MDC/System Designer) my reasons were pretty well the same grievances company wide. My reasons were compounded by favoritism and sexual harassment. Note** MDC was 100% commission based. You could make ALOT of money if you‚Äôre a closer (I am, was one of the top network designers in the country)  Best Buy recently made the largest restructuring they‚Äôve had in over a decade. This roll out was through the pandemic and VERY ROUGH.   They went from hourly, specialized departments to hourly+commission store wide sales consultants. Meaning the sales people had to step out of their ‚Äúcomfort zone‚Äù and learn other parts of the store they were not familiar with. This new business model included in-home ‚ÄúSr. Sales Consultants‚Äù that would advise customers in their homes. On paper and in theory this is a smart move. A personal touch higher paid sales people that are more knowledgeable.   The problem with that is there are only a few guys skilled enough to do these roles and worked mainly on the MDC department along with a handful of Best Buy ‚ÄúIn home advisors‚Äù which were just more entry-level system designers. When they rolled everything out they stripped the majority system designers of their titles, made them focus on lesser products and learn the entire store. And high end or high level jobs would go to the 1 or 2 designers that would then take on everyone‚Äôs workload.   It was stressful as hell It was demoralizing being stripped of a prestigious title. It made us feel like a number in a machine  I personally was offered a pay cut and they tried to make me feel excited about it. (Most got raises, more on that later.) THEN MADE ME WORK MORE! The rest of the store basically got pay raises and demoted. It‚Äôs what it felt like. Payed more to eat more shit.  They stopped caring about the things that made the work place fun and focused heavily on subscription based services (TTS) and coached primarily on that. And getting credit cards. The important managers (GM/SSM) are rarely in the store to address concerns and the company has them hide behind a computer all day doing other things.  They are turning more stores into just warehouses, the staff is trained to hand the customer off to a sales consultant or sr sales consultant. So it makes the worker feel less important. A lot of people are taking pay cuts to leave. In my store alone I can name 6 off the top of my head and more looking for other work. ALL of which where the best employees in the store.   My store went from 7 to 2 designers. One of which was a ‚Äústraight‚Äù man who asked me to have sex with his wife while he watched. Turns out he‚Äôs also both gay and straight. He‚Äôs had multiple sexual harassment accusations. Our store had a new GM take our store over and right before the switch. This GM had known the gay cuck for ‚Äúyears‚Äù Turns out he‚Äôs doing the interviews. Again, I was one of the top networking designers in the country, but he sold more TVs and sound-bars than me. I made the company more money, he sold more entry level product.   They promoted the gay cuck  Try to get me to hand my clients over to him.  My clients were CEOs, Lawyers, Real-estate investors. They were loyal to me. Repeat clients   His customer was a kid who‚Äôs parents own a small phone repair store that bought brackets and entry level TVs from him.   Best Buy is a who you know - blunt force object that pushed all their skilled workers out because they think they don‚Äôt need them. The majority of their money comes from online purchases.   I used to like working there and my experience alllll the way up until the end was mostly positive.",1,1,1,1,1,1.0,1,1.0,7.0,1
What are the most common reasons for employees to leave Best Buy?,"Best Buy is running out of good reasons for people to value working here.

What are the most common reasons for employees to leave Best Buy?,"Let Go Today; I was informed today that I was being terminated due to attendance violations. (Being late, not calling out or no call no showing). It‚Äôs been quite the experience over the last 20 months. The people I‚Äôve worked with, especially in product flow are some of the funniest, most hard-working people I‚Äôve ever known, and I was honored and privileged to work alongside them.   With that being said, Best Buy, as a corporation, is completely and utterly fucked. Starting at the top, Cori Berri is one of the worst executives I‚Äôve ever heard of. She constantly takes this company and drives it into the ground. It almost seems intentional at this point. She is a fucking idiot and I wouldn‚Äôt trust her to run a lemonade stand, let alone a huge corporation.   To one of my managers in particular, you are an asshole. Plain and simple. You constantly call people out over the walkie for stupid things, knowing damn well that it could‚Äôve been a 1on1 conversation, or one that didn‚Äôt need to occur in the first place. Instead, you sit on your ass or stand at the AP and belittle people. Idgaf how long you‚Äôve worked there, you‚Äôre a dick and I hope you eat shit. You constantly bring morale down throughout the store and then wonder why people don‚Äôt have good attitudes.  To the managers, STOP INTERRUPTING CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN SALES FLOOR AND CUSTOMERS. It has to be the most deflating thing in the world when you‚Äôre having a good conversation with a customer, selling them product, learning about them and their interests, and then hearing over the walkie, ‚Äúoo (salesperson‚Äôs name), looks like a good membership opportunity‚Äù. I hear that and I can feel the balloon being deflated. Fuck your stupid memberships, fuck your stupid credit cards, 99% of customers don‚Äôt want it and you make the interactions worse by shoving it down their throats.   With that, Best Buy needs to bring back specialization. One of the biggest complaints that customers have is that ‚Äúyour sales floor doesn‚Äôt know shit about the product.‚Äù Well, how could they? Best Buy wants sales floor to be experts on thousands of products. You know what happens when you try to be an expert on everything? You‚Äôre an expert on nothing. It‚Äôs simply impossible. Best Buy is trying so hard to suck customer‚Äôs dicks and yet, is actively pushing them away every single day.   All in all, I‚Äôm predicting that Best Buy will not make it to 2030. I hope I‚Äôm wrong because workers at Best Buy need jobs. But unfortunately, I see Best Buy following the footsteps of KMart straight to bankruptcy.

What are the most common reasons for employees to leave Best Buy?,"Former employee here. Please unionize if possible. Someone needs to get the ball rolling but once it is people will hop in and push it. Corporate is making it obvious that unions would hurt them in a big way. That's why they go through the effort to control other subreddits and show an anti-union presentation. They know unions are the correct solution to their behaviour, now they're trying as hard as possible to make sure not enough people realize that soon enough to do something. This also may be part of why they're letting leaders go first (and pay ofc). They may be thinking they get rid of all the leaders, and see the rest as sheep that won't make moves to unionize without a leader.",1,0,0,1,1,1.0,1,0.7142857142857143,5.0,1

Do employees feel understaffed?,"I think OP is saying that BEST BUY still makes the same margin on the lower, discounted offer.  So an OEM sale removes our best buy discount because.... why? The discount is provided buy best buy, the sale buy the OEM.  Even with 50% off items, employees should be getting a discount, because Best buy's margin doesn't change.",0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0

Do employees feel understaffed?,"With the upmost respect, the employees are really easily replaceable, coming from a former employee. can't tell you how many times I've gotten no service at all while buying high ticket items.  Went in today for a $700 sound system. PCHO was a nightmare with these 18 year olds walking around laughing, cussing with each other and completely ignoring customers in the aisles. Couldn't tell you how many Edgars were there laughing it up in the middle of the department. Made it to home theater and Didn't get a care in the world while the employees stood around chatting with their thumbs up their ass. Left home theater with a ""do you need help?"" after I've already grabbed my item after looking all over for it. This after employees walked right on by. Waited till you saw you could tack on something right? Most of y'all are useless, and coming from a former employee, I was useless too. I embraced it and apparently so do a lot of employees too. Maybe it's karma but I didn't expect a raise for my shit work. Sorry but I don't feel too bad when the raises don't happen when the majority of the store is shit.",0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0
