I‚Äôve been with the company from 2014 to now; held multiple positions and now just do PT with minimal hours so I can focus on my full time career. I‚Äôve enjoyed working for the company for my time here- things have changed a lot throughout the years we went from RPH and Credit apps to credit apps and totaltech. Most stores don‚Äôt separate into departments anymore; we‚Äôre all ‚ÄúSales Advisors‚Äù and sell everywhere in the store. With past experience you can haggle up to 17/hr but that is max for hiring.

"Just be careful.  BBY is one of the *better* options in working retail, but the company still sucks. I worked there in 2016-17 started in PT sales and worked my way up to FT sales lead until my role was discontinued 1 week into the position. The benefits are just okay and discount pretty generous. However, they focus very hard on unrealistic sales goals, management can be very pushy, and they restructure/eliminate positions/headcount ALL THE TIME.  &#x200B;  More recently, I returned to BBY part time in warehouse (1 day a week, just barely working enough for the discount), but later left just before the holiday season because I did not want to work anymore hours and they were really pressuring me to work. It was a bit more relaxed for me the second time around, mainly because it was 4 hours a week and I did not really care. Warehouse is still very metric/numbers driven, but it's different because you don't have to deal with customers as much, and most of the goals are pretty obtainable depending on how organized your warehouse team is. Although, it's almost impossible to move up in warehouse as your strengths don't show as much as they would in sales/customer service.  &#x200B;  That being said, it can be very easy to move up if you have a positive attitude, play the game of being peppy in their cringe company culture, and obtain/exceed your sales goals. With the turnover, you could land yourself a supervisor position in just a few years. Just don't be discouraged when they restructure and eliminate it, I can guarantee you at some point it will happen.  If you've worked for Walmart, I'm sure BBY is the better option, just learn to play their game. I could be wrong, but I would peg BBY to be in a similar line as Target & Starbucks in regards to quality of the company, but this is just observations and I could be wrong.  &#x200B;  I've also heard Costco has decent benefits, but can't speak to the internal workings of the company and culture. I did work for Apple Retail and really enjoyed working there and was sad when I left to work at a 'real job'.  &#x200B;  WDD",jfqvf59,comment,2023-04-10T17:08:53,t3_12gb7ps,t3_12gb7ps,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/12gb7ps/just_got_the_interview_for_a_best_buy_associate/jfqvf59/,BestBuyWorkers
"This is my honest opinion I just recently left Best Buy after almost a year as part time computer sales. It has its ups and downs.  I found most of my coworkers to be incredible and people I still talk to now after leaving. The work can be easy on slow days as you‚Äôre just Downstocking and facing things.  But the worst part is management and metrics. Although your store may be different, this is just my experience, At my store, some associates are getting paid less then minimum wage. You get no incentive for pushing sales. You‚Äôre basically a scummy sales man. You push and push and if it doesn‚Äôt work you get reprimanded by management. Even having your hours cut down to 4 hours a week if you don‚Äôt meet your goals.  You don‚Äôt get recognized for your efforts but i understand that‚Äôs a lot of workplaces now. A lot of management were misogynistic and did not want to hire women.

"If you don‚Äôt follow the ‚Äúvision‚Äù of management, be prepared to pay for it dearly. Hour cuts, lectures, no promotions and pay increases, etc. If you‚Äôre not meeting the expectations of being a minimum wage employee getting paid hourly AND selling like a commissioned salesman, then expect full annihilation from your leaders.

"I am sorry to all of the workers that are gonna be affected by this. I know exactly how you feel. If you are bored enough to read my stupid life story:  I was part of the grand opening team for a Best Buy in 2006.  35,000 ft.¬≤ I was full-time media, basically a senior, but without the actual position or pay.  We had six managers, 12 supervisors, many seniors, and full timers.  I went through the reorg in 2009 and barely kept my position. Supervisors drop to five, managers drop to four.  My stress gave me ulcers.  Our goals got to unrealistic math levels.  In gaming we had to have 8% service plans, accessories 12.5%, 3% geek squad set up services for consoles ($30 to turn the system on and run updates lol).  I had done the math at the time and management was unpleasant with me when I said this was not possible. Nintendo Wii accessory sales when we had no wii remotes 70 nunchucks.  Assuming we literally sold geek squad, black tie protection on each possible device we would not hit our numbers.  And that‚Äôs assuming that customers come in and literally buy everything we tell them to.    Speaking of more unrealistic, I was told on a Monday morning to replace all of the price tag‚Äôs in gaming, because the wordage for performance replacement, plan (PRP) was rebranded to geek squad black-tie protection replacement plan (GSBTPRP).  I remember telling them that it wasn‚Äôt going to happen today and they got upset. Then I used math to show them that approximately 30 4ft sections of games, each having six shelves, minimum seven tags per row assuming that each game magically had its own spot on the shelf and wasn‚Äôt stacked in front of another game.  Telzon taking about 10sec per tag in our shitty faraday cage of a store.  Takes about 10 sec to remove old tag and put on new tag.  35 hours of labor assuming the tag printer doesn‚Äôt jam, zero customers need help, etc.  and all of this was less than 24 hours after an adset, so basically we had to redo adset is what corporate wanted.  management hated me.  Then there was the gaming initiative in 2011 where I was so optimistic that things were turning around.    At this point I was trying to raise a family and thought this would actually be my career. But then we didn‚Äôt receive enough labor for our team",jaxs9zv,comment,2023-03-04T17:03:24,t3_11hyxkb,t3_11hyxkb,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/11hyxkb/best_buy_is_closing_17_stores_this_week_with_many/jaxs9zv/,BestBuyWorkers
"Then there was the gaming initiative in 2011 where I was so optimistic that things were turning around.    At this point I was trying to raise a family and thought this would actually be my career. But then we didn‚Äôt receive enough labor for our team full-time or had to work 32 1/2 hours supervisor 37 minimum.  We had two part-timers that got about 12 hours each.  Best Buy was talking about how bad shrink was and gaming, just like it always has been, and just like it always will be, but we did not have the labor to be staffed during each open hour.  Not to mention any labor for truck, adset, etc.  Then my position was removed August 2012.  The writing was on the wall.  I could either take severance or any of the available full-time positions that would exist.  Problem is there are three stores in our area, not counting the Best Buy mobiles.  So it was a dog pile of people for one or two positions that paid less than what we made five years ago at that point.    I took the severance, eight years of professional workmanship gone.  but a lot of my former friends and colleagues were still stuck on the Best Buy train wreck.  I joined this sub Reddit just to see how things have been going but it‚Äôs not very optimistic. Most of my bad dreams have been of regular work at Best Buy.  Now, almost everyone I know is out of Best Buy and has long since moved on. Years ago, Best Buy got rid of 401(k), matching I remember reading. Which is the most petty way of saying we don‚Äôt care about our employees and we are pretending that this is a cost savings measure.  The few old coworkers that remained said that they are sharing a manager between multiple stores. Almost nobody is full-time. They have like two supervisors. Which means some key holders are literally part time, so have no stake in the company.  All risk no reward.  Pay is capped at comical levels.  I just needed to get all that off my chest.

From someone who doesn‚Äôt work for Best Buy anymore. Just ask questions about what people are buying or doing not just today but in the near future. That‚Äôs all my team did and we killed it. Let the customer bring the products up and you can add value by connecting the dots.  Hey. So you‚Äôre buying this computer today. What else have you been looking at? Maybe find out if they have moved recently to add tv appliances or home security. Don‚Äôt just focus on the one item. When you get shot down once or twice don‚Äôt give up. You won‚Äôt connect a lot.

"I am a PC DA so this is going to be from a Geek Squad perspective, and it‚Äôs easier for me to sell because it‚Äôs usually cheaper to sell it than what the price of the job would be without TT, but I typically take the ‚Äúnot a salesy salesperson‚Äù approach because I don‚Äôt enjoy pushy salespeople.  In store, you could do this by explaining that TT includes discounts and since it covers services and labor on what they are purchasing, a new PC setup & migration in-store or in-home would be cheaper with TT, plus it includes a better warranty on most devices.   ‚ÄúWould you like me to have one of our Geek Squad agents come set up your new computer? They can transfer the data and make sure everything is working. If you have any questions a few weeks after using it, they can come back out. Typically appointments are $130+ per visit, but with TT, it would just be $200 for the entire year.‚Äù If they start to roll their eyes, I usually feel weird because sales feels gross, so I say, ‚ÄúI know, I have to mention it because it‚Äôs a really good deal,‚Äù and then I will just move right along. Maybe mention it again a little later, ‚Äúso you‚Äôre going to set this up and transfer your data yourself, right?‚Äù *As I type this, I am realizing I am a manipulative little shit and maybe I do like sales hmm‚Ä¶*  Do you know any of the Geek Squad agents in your precinct? I know salespeople in the store will mention my name when they offer in-home services; It may feel more personable that way. If you mention a specific agent with experience in what you‚Äôre client is purchasing, they may feel like they are getting the hook-up *(‚ÄúChristineth is our Apple guru so if you‚Äôre having iCloud issues, we could book an appointment for her to come sync your devices AND show you how to use this Apple Pencil I am selling you?‚Äù)* and it might help the client feel more comfortable with an agent coming out if they don‚Äôt typically utilize home services. *Hmm it‚Äôs just Christineth.

"judge my model train collection.*  If you sell a printer, you can have an agent set it up on the client‚Äôs Wi-Fi, show them how to print/scan from any device, how to replace the cartridges, all that printer stuff. If there are any issues with said printer, GS can come back out to troubleshoot.  Offer installation for security cameras, tablets, doorbells, modem/routers, TVs, soundbars, computer speakers, smart switches, a Roku, etc. I have gone to homes to set up a $20 wireless mouse or connect a $40 webcam. Probably unlikely that you will be able to sell $200 memberships on a little accessory like that very often, but I think it helps to talk about it with everyone. Some people are rich and dumb as hell. I say that with love.   If they are buying one thing and mention their slow internet, an agent can come out, set up the product and check the internet speeds/equipment while they are there (just make sure to book the appointment with enough time).  The warranty that is included with TT is pretty baller too + vague in-store discounts lol.

"New to this Sub: Advice?; Hey! Brand new to this sub as of today, and I'm thinking about applying to be a Retail Sales Ass.

"I quite like my job at Canadian Best Buy. But online I see a lot of talk of overwork from understaffing due to U.S. leadership decisions. Have a google but also, don't get too put off. We've been downsized a bit too but it's not crazy all the time or anything. Sometimes a little stressful and got too much going on at once, but if you've worked a rush in a restaurant you're probably used to worse. If they got hours for ya, I'd send her. But in my experience it's who you work with, not what you're doing. So vet them as they vet you. Maybe go in before applying and get the vibe. Talk to a sales rep at the place. Wear a mask if you wanna be a little incognito.   Talking about tech while enjoying air conditioning isn't the worst.

Am I in the wrong?; So some back ground there‚Äôs a sup at my store who hasn‚Äôt liked me since I got hired.  The other day I was told by my Asm that I was staying until 9 to close with her the sup.  But then as 8pm rolled around the sup tells me I‚Äôm not staying that someone from warehouse is‚Ä¶ok no big deal I walk over to my Asm and tell her so and so is staying to close so I was going to leave once I pulled the registers.  She asks over the mic what time so and so leaves and the sup responds with 9pm that they‚Äôre closing the store and doing a walk.  And then the sup comes up to me and says I need to quit playing mom and dad with  them‚Ä¶..   The only time I‚Äôve had to play ‚Äúmom and dad‚Äù is when she the sup tells me how to do something and it doesn‚Äôt work so I say that didn‚Äôt work and the response is always it did‚Ä¶.

"I am in agreement!  It is very telling how badly workers have been groomed to default to freaking out and attacking one another on topics like this.  The folks that start calling for fellow humans to just ""work or leave"" have been lost to us and go out of their way to viciously defend corp and store leadership.  If they put that same energy into standing in solidarity with their fellow workers, we wouldn't even need a walkout of any kind.  Because if we did stand together we could actually be at the table.    I have had some very good times and met lots of friends and other cool people at BBY.  It has had times where they showed attempts at good-faith employee relations.  Also the point of said walkout is about those of us that actually care about making the company better.  The bootlickers yell ""don't like it, then leave!"" shit as if just finding a new job is like buying candy, and like we shouldn't be treated like humans.  Doing something like a walkout or forming a union is all what happens when the ""correct"" channels are taken but ignored.  They do so much that just counteracts everything we are constantly told.  We are the ones that have to deal with any and all customer/client rage and confusion that comes from badly setup ideas changing in ways that go against how large chunks of said shoppers/clients expect things.  Corp will just keep bad ideas going even if it is painfully obvious that it isn't working.  The folks that seem to make the plans are all super disconnected from the real world and real people (and I imagine they just want to speed up the latter fast enough to not be the one to deal with blow back).  If the stuff isn't working based on back and white metrics, it is us that are surely the issue and not their ""amazing idea"".    The current setup is based on trying to make more and more money than the record breaking years of 2020 and 2021 isn't sustainable.  Those years shouldn't be used in the same way that normal years are.  Sales went nuts because all of a sudden so many people had to quickly get or upgrade stuff to simply keep working and/or going to school.  Much like how so many streaming services are seeing big drops in subs.  Of course more people will sign up for streaming media when they can't go places like they normally would.

"seeing big drops in subs.  Of course more people will sign up for streaming media when they can't go places like they normally would.  Which also means that projections for those services shouldn't keep planning for those numbers to keep growing instead of dropping.  So we see budgets slashed, things canceled, and lots and lots of workers laid off in desperate efforts to make the numbers look like things are still booming from a shareholders standpoint.  Which can only work for so long (especially if top people keep giving themselves higher and higher bonuses) before everything just falls apart dramatically.   If we didn't care, then obviously we would just leave.  We need things to be done in ways that work for both workers and the top.  If they are going to keep forcing us to watch lame elearnings about ""mental health importance"" and ""really caring about respecting each other"".  Then they could also start doing stuff that materially impacts workers lives in positive ways.  The ""customer obsession and building relationships"" nonsense is completely undermined by running everything so super lean in all departments.  Leaders freak the hell out if even two people are in a line, and just drag others that are already helping in some way into it.  But they could've allowed more people to be helped by getting in there and doing it themselves.  All that running around to find someone is time they could've just did it.  I hope that the stores that were the starting point of this walkout go through with it and in big numbers (I may if it happens in my area).  They can fire us all, but at a certain point it bites them hard if they were to do so.  All the extra and useless stuff needed to train new people has gotten so bad in some departments that it couldn't be done fast enough.    We just want respect and not constant gaslighting with threats that go along with it.  We want to not be doing all the jobs at the same time (especially when it is stuff that is outside our capacity).  The company used to have people that knew shit about their departments and could really answer questions or give advice to customers/clients.  Now in the moment Google and pray for real and not scam shit is normal.  We could fix so much of the new inefficiencies by having real scheduling and staffing.

So make sure u are actually doing them.  U can also call ur mgr and ask if u can come in for another short shift in next couple days to complete e-learnings.

"The advice really depends on what you‚Äôre going for. Are you looking to work on the sales floor, in the warehouse or at Geek Squad? The only tip I‚Äôll add that‚Äôs generic is don‚Äôt waste too much time with this company: if you don‚Äôt advance within a few years it‚Äôs likely going to be more effective to get hired on someplace else and use your experience at Best Buy as a selling point to your next employer.

Nope. Your allowed to talk to anyone about pay. Management can get pissy about if they want but can't do anything.,ivd83be,comment,2022-11-06T21:34:19,t3_yoa9td,t3_yoa9td,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/yoa9td/can_i_get_fired_for_talking_about_pay/ivd83be/,BestBuyWorkers
"It's against the law to prevent you from talking about pay. The very fact that you feel awkward about doing this is a prime reason WHY there's a law that protects doing so. Like others have said, you do have to be careful about whom you share pay information with and large companies have enough impossible-to-follow regulations that terminating you for talking about pay can be legally excused as something else, but until the culture of silence changes and workers organize and stand up for themselves, it will only get worse and cold-blooded executives like Corie Barry will reap huge personal fortunes while grinding both employees and the company itself into nothing.      It sounds like your ""friend"" is a lazy person who demands special treatment already and your management most likely sees her work assignment as fitting compensation for her job performance, no matter how much longer she's been there than you. She can't do anything to you officially, but you may want to distance yourself from her as she may allow her frustration to motivate her to file false things about you, and if I read you correctly, she's already threatening you for making more. Use this interaction as a personal growth opportunity for you.

"Managers not letting me quit??; So I've been dealing with a really weird situation recently. For background, I'm a college student in my late 20's. Been working in retail for nearly a decade. I didn't finish my bachelor's when I was younger, but I went back to school last year to finish my degree so I don't have to work retail for the rest of my life. I am in a fortunate position with scholarships and financial aid that I don't necessarily need to work while I'm in school, but I thought I'd stick with Best Buy for a little extra cash and for the employee discount.  &#x200B;  When my current semester started a couple of weeks ago I quickly realized that my homework and assigned readings are going to be far more time-consuming than previous semesters. So a week and a half ago I informed my GM that I was giving my two weeks notice so I could focus exclusively on my studies. He basically disregarded me and said I'd have to speak with my immediate supervisor, who was on vacation at the time. The following week I had to call off on truck night because I had too much homework, and my ASM manager calls me saying I need to manage my time better and that they'll just schedule me for less shifts or on different days. And like the GM, he just ignored that fact that I said I'm quitting and continued to schedule me.  &#x200B;  Then when I was working this weekend, my ASM again tried to talk to me about my schedule in a very manipulative way, ignoring me when I say I'm quitting and continuing to talk about just working less hours or staying on as occasional/seasonal. I finally had to assert myself and clearly confirm that I am quitting. Then I ask to confirm that my last shift will be in the coming week, and my ASM says, ""No, you just gave your two-week notice, so you will have to work two more weeks,"" completely ignoring the fact that I had already given my two-week notice to the GM more than a week previous. On this same shift I'm dealing with the usual understaffing that my store and every other store has been dealing with. For the final two-thirds of my 9.5-hour shift I was the only product flow employee in the store. I was so stressed out during that shift that I was seriously considering walking",xcctn9,submission,2022-09-12T09:26:14,,,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/xcctn9/managers_not_letting_me_quit/,BestBuyWorkers

I was so stressed out during that shift that I was seriously considering walking out mid-shift and never coming back. I did finish my shift, but there is no way in hell I'm staying with this company.  &#x200B;  Since my managers will not listen to me, I am seriously considering just employing the quitting-by-not-showing-up method, which is not something I ever thought I'd do, but what other choice do I have?",xcctn9,submission,2022-09-12T09:26:14,,,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/xcctn9/managers_not_letting_me_quit/,BestBuyWorkers

At that point IF you ever want to be considered for possible employment in the future I‚Äôd call HR and file a complaint. Your store probably has job termination forms already printed out that you SHOULD have been given the first time you said you wanted to leave.   Most GMs would have immediately offered to move you to OS or just schedule you less. Most want to help with school. I‚Äôve seen one schedule someone for a day in a month.

"Every 5 years you get to pick from an online catalog of sorts. It‚Äôs the equivalent of around $150. Should get an email around your anniversary date with a link of where to go. At least I did.

"EDIT: Reddit wouldn't let me embed image in post.  Hey, So I work frequently with Best Buy on their liquidation end, and I sometimes see some crazy, (and sketchy shit). I'd like a employees perspective, so I got some questions..  I stumbled across a lot with 18K 2019 Office Activation cards. Now, after doing some research, these cards are not activated until purchased. So is Best Buy trying to pawn off useless plastic cards or are these cards actually activated?  **The lot is already ended so this information will in no way benefit anyone. I am just curious if I dodged a train or roughly $1.7M in Microsoft office suites?**  The reason I ask is Best Buy has ""accidently"" sold many lots of product that ""shouldn't"" have been sold to the public liquidators.

I appreciate the info. Best Buy often throws a random number for MSRP so $1 is really not their approximated value.

"A bit of clarification here for a common misconception. You are correct, there is nothing wrong (depending on the local laws) with recording in public places. However, retail locations and most other businesses are not public areas. It is private property that you are allowed to come purchase items from during certain times of the day. Actual public areas fall along the lines of sidewalks, streets, parks, etc. They are usually locations owned by the city/state and paid for by taxpayers (the general public). Business buildings, even their parking lots, are owned by landlords or the business themselves not the general public.  Either way, in almost all circumstances, you should always ask permission to film. It should be common courtesy out of shear decency, especially to people who are just trying to do their job.",il8mriq,comment,2022-08-21T16:59:28,t3_wtr1q0,t1_il8d4bc,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/wtr1q0/honestly_a_pretty_stupid_reason_to_call_the_cops/il8mriq/,BestBuyWorkers

"Hi!  So the answer you're looking for is yes, as long as it follows the Best Buy ""Qualified Gift"" rules (available through HR) you should be fine. I don't know all the specifics however the main ones that I remember are:  * You have to be making a gift purchase to be given to an individual for individual use, or to a qualified non-profit organization * Cannot purchase items for use in for profit business, or to be intended for resale using employee discount  * Employee cannot be reimbursed by the person/organization you're giving the gift to * Additionally, it is my understanding that employees may purchase GSP/ Protection and services/ installations as qualified gifts as well.  If you purchase through dotcom make sure the shipping/ delivery address is for that person, not your address * I personally recommended that the services/ GSP be setup in the name of the person / organization you're giving the gift to * Also recommend that you put the gift purchase on it's own sale/purchase and don't combine with other personal purchases * Strongly recommend you provide the giftee with a gift receipt, if not a copy of the actual receipt for their records, and in case anything happens where they have to warranty claim on it. *  If you're shipping to a different store for pickup, make sure you list the person picking up the product's actual first and last name as it says on their state issued ID, and tell them to bring state issued ID with them to pickup.  Finally, be aware that employee purchases, including qualified gifts, are tracked and can be scrutinized by internal audit / asset protection teams and discounted goods/ services/ etc. may also count as taxable non-wage income on your W-2. If you have specific questions, don't take my word for it--follow up with a inquiry to HR about the qualified gift policy to make sure you're making the right choices and following the procedures correctly.   TLDR: Yes you can use employee discount for QUALIFIED GIFTS. There is a policy. Follow up with HR for specific details on what you can and can't do.

"Just so it's clear; Corie Barry, and by extension the executive board, has stated PUBLICLY that the ultimate goal of the company is to reduce ALL of its employees and storefronts. Her ""vision"" is for a single worker in a store manning a pick up counter, period, with no thought to logistics, services, customer experience and certainly not employees. She WILL eventually cut EVERY full time worker- management, sales, warehouse, distribution and everything else. The endgame appears to be reduce Best Buy to being an IP that will be sold to Amazon and Amazon will take over the actual operational costs while it gains a  retail showroom. So for any of you who thought that timeline was somewhere far off in the future, take a HARD look at a week ago, the second massive layoff in two years.  She is intentionally crippling the stores so that she can justify closing them when sales inevitably fall after lack of service drives customers completely out of brick and mortar. Her ""facts"" used to justify doing this are a set of self-fulfilling dictums which falsely inflate online sales figures while minimizing brick and mortar contributions, and she's either too greedy or too stupid to see that either she is being fed bad information or more likely, she is the source of that misinformation.  Right now, cutting staff can produce short term gains, but it is at the cost of long-term stability and sustainability and she knows that. When the stock value inevitably starts tanking hard and doesn't stop, the short term losses it causes will be assets, as she and the board can buy back even more shares of the company and when the sale to Amazon goes through, those shares will become worth billions.

He talked to his supervisor and was able to get approval to issue me $900 in gift cards instead of a refund. Okay, cool, no biggie. He said it would be split into 2 because of the high dollar amount.  Again, cool.  After 2 hours on the phone, he assured me we were good to go and gave me a reference number ‚Äújust in case.‚Äù   I called in today to ask if they could give me the gift card number over the phone so I could make on online purchase before the physical cards arrive. After being transferred 4 times, I finally am talking to someone who says he can help. The previous people had mentioned they saw the cards were issued, but couldn‚Äôt see the codes due to the high dollar amount. The rep I‚Äôm talking to eventually tells me that that those gift cards weren‚Äôt actually issued and I wouldn‚Äôt be getting them. He said it was because one gift card had already been issued to me and they can only do one gift card per order. The gift card I had received was for like $150 because I had a hell of a time getting the contractors to come out and install the waterline for my fridge. The conversation ended with me talking to his supervisor who told me he could offer a gift card for $200 but that was it. He said he was the highest level of supervisor to talk to, he agreed I was entitled to the full $900 but said he could only do $200 and that I shouldn‚Äôt have trusted the previous reps that I had talked to?? I asked if he could connect me to someone else or if there was a customer relations department and he said he didn‚Äôt know and suggested I could hang up and call back to talk to someone else.

Question about starting wage for sales advisor; What is the starting wage for a part-time sales advisor?

It's 15 starting and you cap out at 17. A lot of people don't realize that when they raised the minimum they decreased the wage gap from new hires to tenured people by a lot.

Purchasing pro is during open enrollment and it‚Äôs a max of 40hrs a year I do every year! Its not really purchasing pto u have to think of it as setting your pay aside for when u decide to take a week off and still get paid. The cost of your pto days is based on your yearly salary. So however much you get paid per week is how much your 40 hours of pto will cost you. The benefit is that you can use them the first week in January if u want to even though they haven‚Äôt been paid for yet because they take it out a little each pay check.

I've had a varied experience with different managers. The purchasing of PTO is just extra unnecessary steps so it feels like something sneaky is afoot. One year I miscalculated 1 hour of PTO to use it up before reset since it doesn't roll over and went negative.

I legitimately feel like they should just make sales commission on apps/TT and get it over with (like $5 for every Best Buy credit card and $10 for every TT).

I‚Äôll also mention the store is in a suburb of Cleveland Ohio so it‚Äôs not like mega busy or anything. Does anyone have any tips for getting hired?

Did you go asking or was this new hire paperwork? I don‚Äôt remember where it is written down but full timers must be scheduled 32hours. If I have a chance to go looking today I can tell you.

it was unprompted. A ton of people weren‚Äôt even getting 32 hours.

The company is losing my $15K appliance purchase over this.  Check the other subreddit and you'll see a lot of pissed off customers many of which are returning items or buying elsewhere from now on.  When someone gets points and becomes an upper tier member like myself we expect certain things and one of them is not for the program we just qualified for a month or two back to go away with 6 weeks notice.  Who does that?  Oh wait. That's right it's the new CEO who's taking something that's working and killing it. Did they learn nothing from JC Penney and similar companies that pulled this stunt and now struggle to survive?    Most won't read the email and will be shocked when they find out and they'll complain by no longer doing business with BB.    There's to many options out there for a company to pull a stunt like this.     Let's not mention the email being vague and not informing their customers of all the details of all the things that they are losing.   I don't get these companies.   Oh well. I'm going back to buying local. I didn't save that much going to BB. I did it for the points and such.   The local place will love to see me walk back in.

Current Elite Plus and for the moment Total Tech member - I find this move to be an ethical breach of contract.  The deal was we spent a certain level last year and get benefits this year.  Now Best Buy is reneging on the deal mid year.  At the very least this should have been an end of year move.  I‚Äôm sure they have lots of safe harbor ‚Äúwe have all the rights you have none‚Äù fine print items to prevent an actual breach of contract legal action but ethically speaking I think that‚Äôs what they‚Äôve done here.

"I really make a point to not purchase on Amazon as they are getting too big - so that means Best Buy when I can. Elite Plus member here - but barely. I rerouted a purchase to Best Buy in December to get me over the line for the next year.  I also managed to get a nice video card from Best Buy at MSRP last year because they did a nice job with the anti-bot tech - and didn't give in to raising prices beyond MSRP like for example newegg. I wrote a glowing review of the product and best buy because it felt like they were really batting for me ""Joe Consumer"" and being ethical about pricing. Next round of video cards were only made available to those who paid for Best Buy's Total Tech. Don't need that personally.  I'm in IT, I get the simplification piece of doing away with all the tiers - but that was sunk cost for the most part it seems. ""Simplification"" seems like a mostly made-up reason.   As other have said, this was a program that was clearly working to do what a rewards program should - routing dollars to the business instead of another business. To what level it is hard to say - maybe not enough. Feels like they are going the wrong way with this - and maybe Total Tech should have been included in Elite Plus as a perk.  All that said, I'm still routing my $ to BestBuy when possible to help them survive. They are the only real electronics store near me left. From there, my only options are Walmart and Target or maybe Kohls for small appliances - and they have a much more limited - and lower tier list of items for sale in store.",i6gbd5z,comment,2022-04-27T17:19:25,t3_tqejhm,t3_tqejhm,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/tqejhm/my_best_buy_changes/i6gbd5z/,BestBuyWorkers

That can't come soon enough. I have been an elite plus member (or its past equivalent) for over 15 years...back when you paid for the membership. They should've announced the changes effective the end of the year. The points is one thing but taking away the free shipping after people have made a point of attaining the mid/high tier for that benefit is lower than anything CC did.  I won't say that I'm not going to enter a Best Buy again. That would be a lie. However I will not spend another cent there. By making this change Best Buy has told their most loyal customers that they don't value loyalty.

"Mostly to grab something at the last minute when I couldn't wait what has been an ever slowing Prime delivery. I've completely stopped using Best Buy shipping just based on principle (being charged after having earned free shipping). I now only use it for the same thing that eventually killed CC...a showroom to look at something before jumping on the Amazon app (usually while still in the store). Even the BF deals on media get matched or are ""lightning deals"" on Amazon. I feel for the employees who work at a place whose leadership keeps letting them down.

"TV came broken, didn't open for 4 months due to basement remodel, out of exchange period now. What can I do?; Bought an 82"" Samsung TV for my basement remodel during Black Friday. Remodel ran long so the TV sat safely in its box upstairs in an office. When the remodel finally finished early this month, I brought the TV down and unboxed it and turned it on just to find that the display was either defective or cracked. It looks like it took a bit of a hit before being boxed.      I have heard that this is not all that uncommon and that BestBuy or Samsung with generally take them back, but only during the 30 day exchange period. Since I was unaware of the fault (as I waited for the basement to be ready for the TV), I am quite a bit out of that 30 day period.      TV was purchased from BestBuy, but they are saying they can do nothing to help me. It has been more than 30 days, and they say anything after that falls under Samsung's window.      Samsung says that it is ""clearly accidental damage"" when I show them photos. I guess I understand where they may be coming from, but the TV has safely been in a box for the last few months. There was no damage to the box. They just say that I am lying.      It was purchased on Amex, but they seem to only give me extended protection for 60 days. Out of luck there too.      Am I just completely screwed out of thousands of dollars now because I was sold a broken TV? I don't feel like I should have fault just for leaving it aside for a bit. Do I have any additional options for recourse?",tqcpc5,submission,2022-03-28T12:07:08,,,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/tqcpc5/tv_came_broken_didnt_open_for_4_months_due_to/,BestBuyWorkers

"Rant Time!; Rant time!  I work in mobile and my store gets so busy throughout the day, most days, and we are so understaffed due to corporate not only extending our operating hours, but also taking away around 8 hours of labor from our department, that I am working back to back with customers that have been waiting in the queue for 20+ minutes.   What this leads to is most mobile associates not being able to take our California government required 10min rest breaks.   I‚Äôm not sure about other states, but in California we are apparently supposed to get paid an extra hour of labor at our regular rate for each break we are not given and even though nobody at Best Buy explicitly says ‚Äúno you can‚Äôt take a break‚Äù, it is  heavily implied that we shouldn‚Äôt (especially when we are super busy).   Best Buy reports record profits but keeps cutting labor which puts the pressure even more on us because we have to keep picking up the slack for missing coworkers, which is also leading to an ever decreasing moral and mental health of employees, leading to more call outs and even more missing labor.   Best Buy corporate needs to either start hiring more people or implement break tracking with TLC to make sure employees are getting properly compensated for missing breaks. While employees own a certain amount of responsibility to make sure they take their breaks, the company owns even more of that responsibility as they don‚Äôt schedule enough people in specialized departments like mobile, who can cover for breaks.   So assuming you‚Äôve been working full time for Best Buy for a few years and how many breaks you have been forced to skip due to low coverage. 40 breaks? 100 breaks? So many you don‚Äôt even know what a break is anymore?  If the company minimum wage is $15/hr, how much money has Best Buy stolen from you? One hundred breaks at minimum wage is $1500, granted a decent chunk of that is taxed and I don‚Äôt know about you, but shoot I sure could use the rest for bills.

Im getting 1 shift a week plus truck night. So I work 2 days a week. Totaling at about 11 or 12 hours at best.   I should have found another job a long time ago. My paycheck is only 22 hours every 2 weeks.   Also haven't gotten reviews done. Havent gotten a pay increase since the covid $15 bump. Its 2022.

"How to prepare as a customer experience specialist?; Am I going to be pressured to up sell credit cards and services like people say?

"Yes, but as long as you‚Äôre making genuine offers that should be where the pressure ends. This is also where top down selling helps with credit cards anyways because if someone pushes back on price it‚Äôs an organic point to bring up deferred interest financing. For services it‚Äôll require a combination of listening and probing questions (if someone asks about getting a TV mounted that‚Äôs a good spot to open up about how you can help, if you‚Äôre selling a computer ask if they‚Äôll need help getting it set up and stuff moved to their new one from their old one, etc).   During training you‚Äôll get a number of examples like this that are department specific, and with some practice it should become natural for you to work it in to your interactions.",hxg65qq,comment,2022-02-18T09:26:24,t3_sv7wub,t3_sv7wub,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/sv7wub/how_to_prepare_as_a_customer_experience_specialist/hxg65qq/,BestBuyWorkers
Just do your job and don‚Äôt worry about the rest. As long as you are doing your part they shouldn‚Äôt harass you about cards and what not. It‚Äôs about how you pitch it and if the customer finds the benefits in it that you‚Äôve pitched then boom there you go. I haven‚Äôt seen many line level associates be booted for bad performance. Maybe it‚Äôs the work force or lack of people in it but if you learn and try your best you‚Äôll be fine.,hykb364,comment,2022-02-26T16:34:14,t3_sv7wub,t3_sv7wub,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/sv7wub/how_to_prepare_as_a_customer_experience_specialist/hykb364/,BestBuyWorkers

"Need Advice made a mistake!; Hello I just started working here a little over a month ago. Earlier today I did a price match on a Mr. Coffee frappe machine. A customer wanted me to price match the one from Walmart. The one we sold was 109.99 while the one on Walmarts website was 99.00. I double checked by typing in the model number into Google to see if it would bring it up, and it did. I thought I read the numbers right and went ahead and price matched it.   The make, the color, that was the same.   Just found out the model number was NOT the same as I initially thought.   The model I sold her was 2149282.   The model I price matched was 2142925.   It was a major oversight on my part because I thought they were the same when I also looked it up in Walmarts online app. And I did it again but now it's saying it can't be found! I heard a horror story how Best BUY priced matched some premium appliances and as a result the company couldn't sell the appliances for years!   And a manager did approve of this he took me for my word! And now I feel like shit! Is he going to get in trouble because of me?! What should I do? I really don't wanna be the reason we can't sell Mr. Coffee stuff anymore! And I really don't want that manager to lose his job because of my dumbass mistake!

Any Small Parcel Drivers on here?; I‚Äôve been a SP driver for a year now and have been told the ENTIRE YEAR that they are expecting the workload to pickup and as a result Ill be able to get my hours in.   I‚Äôve been a full time employee for 8 months. For the first 4 of those months I‚Äôve averaged 11 hours due to package load. Whenever I expressed a concern about my hours I was always told ‚Äúit will pick up‚Äù or ‚Äúyou can ask the warehouse of your store for work and get your hours there‚Äù. Whenever I go to the warehouse for hours they tell me they don‚Äôt need me. Besides I don‚Äôt have the same access to programs as they do so I am unable to help out doing the work needing to be done without having a warehouse employee babysitting my computer.   Same days started up and I started getting more work. I‚Äôm grateful for it BUT I am still only scheduled 32 hours. On average I only work 28 of those hours.   I want there to be a daily rate or guaranteed 40 hours. I‚Äôm tired of working 2 jobs to make ends meet because my full time job won‚Äôt compensate me.

Have been since March when they expanded it and told a shit ton of employees to go fuck themselves. For awhile I was getting 35 hours thats mostly because we where splitting a day with a part time employee. That's recently changed and I should be closed to about 37 to 38 a week. I could easily be doing about 45 to 50 hours a week if I didn't have a second job I like and I could see shit after 5pm. We also have a seasonal working evenings so I can't stay out past 4 since they need the stuff when they come in.,hmgbsck,comment,2021-11-28T17:00:11,t3_r4f01w,t3_r4f01w,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/r4f01w/any_small_parcel_drivers_on_here/hmgbsck/,BestBuyWorkers

Ask them to cut the part time person down to 2. All stores in my area the part timer is at 2 days. Mine is at 2 and an afternoon. I'd your full time and arely getting 32 hours keep an eye on your average. If it goes below that for to long you can loose benefits.,hmgd1jn,comment,2021-11-28T17:08:42,t3_r4f01w,t1_hmgcrek,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/r4f01w/any_small_parcel_drivers_on_here/hmgd1jn/,BestBuyWorkers

"Scheduling is a complete joke...; I am 18 and in high school, have worked for best buy for over 1 year as a product flow specialist. My availability is listed as 25 hours a week maximum. The week before Black Friday, this week, and the following I am getting 40+ hours. I asked my manager about this the Sat. before black Friday and was told ""it is only 2 weeks of the year that suck, I am scheduled 70 hours; deal with it"". Well, one of those weeks has passed and the other isn't for a month, so why am I BEING SCHEDULED FOR 40 HOURS???? This is such a joke, I do not want to waste my life away. I am being worked more than the full-time employees. Does anyone know what I should do to fix this, I just sent a text to my manager but will not get a response until tomorrow because it is 2 am.

Right so heres the thing with best buy they do not care if you walk out because they will simply fire you and attempting to unionize they would do the same thing and replace you because its going to save them money and time in the end.

"Best Buy Doesn't Care About Employees; Do you have no friends? No family? No outside interests? Then Best Buy is the job for you, because you'll never have time for those things, and they don't care! They own you, and they'll make sure you know it.   Want time off? Good luck! Especially around the holidays. They lose so many employees and are constantly understaffed because of the horrible way they treat people. But guess what? Because you stick around its your job to make up for their inadequacy! So don't you dare ask for time off. But watch the GM's come and go as they please, working ""half days"" or pretending they showed up at 6am to leave at 2pm on a Saturday, or scheduling full weeks ""working from home"".   Customers get to treat you like shit. They yell and cuss at you and Best Buy will just allow it. Better thicken up that skin before your shift.   Want a regular schedule so you can plan your life? HA! Your schedule will NEVER be the same week to week (except to know you work at least 6 days a week). If you are lucky enough to get 2 days off, they're split. And your shifts will look something like; 10am-8pm, 11am- 10pm. I'd love someone to genuinely explain how you have a life with those kinds of shifts 6 days a week. You will never have a weekend day off ever again.   Bottom line, Best Buy exhibits behavior that their employees are expendable and replaceable. Its clear they no longer see a value in people at all. Probably because they realized during 2020 they could make more money moving their platform online.

"Pre $15/hr increase workers denied 3 percent raise. New employees at 1 year receive.; I've been with bestbuy since 2019. It was a soft place to land when I left my long term degree field career to follow my dream of being a highschool history teacher.  The promise of fair wages,  annual increases,  tuition reimbursement,  and flexible hours was a dream.  Though I had to scrimp and scrape to make that dream work.  I started at $10/hr part time,  and with hard work and great numbers for a noob was given the first available full time spot and moved to $10.50 roughly four months later, and eventually $10.95 at my one year with ""Rockstar"" across the board. I respected my managers and still do, they're great and genuine leaders. I think of my best buy Co workers as some of my closest friends and even family, while also brining friends on with the promise of a fair place to work as long as you're willing to do your job and learn new things while helping others ""discover what's possible"". When covid hit, there was no question in my mind that bestbuy was taking care of me, So, I would risk it and stay on curbside with only 7 other employees, and a couple managers in my store, deciding to not furlough. I had class, dealt with covid and was the best employee I could be for one of the best companies I had worked for. Finally, after covid we were all given increases to $15/hr starting wage. When people were staring to be let go because of the wage increase, I started looking for opportunities elsewhere. I quickly found a better paying job, plus commission at a spectrum retail location closer to home. Because I respect and care what my GM and ASM think, I went to them and asked them if I were in a position where it may come to down to having to choose between me and another employee to let me know, because I had another opportunity, though I didn't want to leave what I considered a home away from home. I was assured my job was never in question and a few days later was told I would be getting an increase of .50 cents that corporate had authorized GMs to give to employees that had deserved more than the $15/hr bump. Which, I really appreciated the recognition from my GM.

"of .50 cents that corporate had authorized GMs to give to employees that had deserved more than the $15/hr bump. Which, I really appreciated the recognition from my GM. My 3 year mark just hit in September and I was expecting the 3 percent increase that the people hired in at $15/hr received when we first opened back after the shut down. Two cheques passed and nothing. So, I called HR. Where they started treating me like I was stupid, the lady tried to tell me my .50 cent increase that I've had for almost a year was my 3 percent. I ""kindly"" gave her a math lesson, that 3 percent of 15 is .47 and that I should have that on top of the .50 cents my GM gave me with the general increase. After telling the lady she could stop lying and should just tell me if I was getting the increase or not, she finally said because I went from $10.95/hr to $15/hr they were considering that my yearly increase and would not be seeing the three percent promised to every employee by Corey in our email about the $15 minimum. Well, turns out that if you started at $15, you do get the 3 percent. Allowing employees that have only been with the company for a year to make more than those that had been here for years. Me being lucky am .03 cents ahead of the noobs in my store, but there are others that started around the same time I did, still only making $15 at their three year. While mediocre, and even under performing 1 year associates, unwilling to lift anything heavier than a toaster or try to sell enablers are making more. I made million dollar club the same month I hit three years. looking at that and then 700 plus branded payments and 600 plus TTS, I've peddaled to my clients, I feel like I've been slapped in the face by a company that I had decided to stick with, because I felt I was appreciated and valued. Seeing that they value every year I've spent here as .01 cent higher per year than what they value someone who's been here for a year, or gone from part time to full-time.

"Well, I worked there for 4 years. 3 of being in the highest ranked sales position in the company (MDC/System Designer) my reasons were pretty well the same grievances company wide. My reasons were compounded by favoritism and sexual harassment. Note** MDC was 100% commission based. You could make ALOT of money if you‚Äôre a closer (I am, was one of the top network designers in the country)  Best Buy recently made the largest restructuring they‚Äôve had in over a decade. This roll out was through the pandemic and VERY ROUGH.   They went from hourly, specialized departments to hourly+commission store wide sales consultants. Meaning the sales people had to step out of their ‚Äúcomfort zone‚Äù and learn other parts of the store they were not familiar with. This new business model included in-home ‚ÄúSr. Sales Consultants‚Äù that would advise customers in their homes. On paper and in theory this is a smart move. A personal touch higher paid sales people that are more knowledgeable.   The problem with that is there are only a few guys skilled enough to do these roles and worked mainly on the MDC department along with a handful of Best Buy ‚ÄúIn home advisors‚Äù which were just more entry-level system designers. When they rolled everything out they stripped the majority system designers of their titles, made them focus on lesser products and learn the entire store. And high end or high level jobs would go to the 1 or 2 designers that would then take on everyone‚Äôs workload.   It was stressful as hell It was demoralizing being stripped of a prestigious title. It made us feel like a number in a machine  I personally was offered a pay cut and they tried to make me feel excited about it. (Most got raises, more on that later.) THEN MADE ME WORK MORE! The rest of the store basically got pay raises and demoted. It‚Äôs what it felt like. Payed more to eat more shit.  They stopped caring about the things that made the work place fun and focused heavily on subscription based services (TTS) and coached primarily on that. And getting credit cards. The important managers (GM/SSM) are rarely in the store to address concerns and the company has them hide behind a computer all day doing other things.  They are turning more stores into just warehouses, the staff is trained to hand the customer off to a sales consultant or sr sales consultant. So it makes the worker feel less important. A lot of people are taking pay cuts",hudxu80,comment,2022-01-26T21:42:39,t3_qpi3rj,t1_huddqx5,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/qpi3rj/really_need_this_job_just_received_the_text_to_do/hudxu80/,BestBuyWorkers

So it makes the worker feel less important. A lot of people are taking pay cuts to leave. In my store alone I can name 6 off the top of my head and more looking for other work. ALL of which where the best employees in the store.   My store went from 7 to 2 designers. One of which was a ‚Äústraight‚Äù man who asked me to have sex with his wife while he watched. Turns out he‚Äôs also both gay and straight. He‚Äôs had multiple sexual harassment accusations. Our store had a new GM take our store over and right before the switch. This GM had known the gay cuck for ‚Äúyears‚Äù Turns out he‚Äôs doing the interviews. Again, I was one of the top networking designers in the country, but he sold more TVs and sound-bars than me. I made the company more money, he sold more entry level product.   They promoted the gay cuck  Try to get me to hand my clients over to him.  My clients were CEOs, Lawyers, Real-estate investors. They were loyal to me. Repeat clients   His customer was a kid who‚Äôs parents own a small phone repair store that bought brackets and entry level TVs from him.

The discount hasn't really changed. Just the actual cost of product has gone up therefor we pay more with the discount since it's based on percent above cost.   Only big advantage we have over target is we hire full time employees they do not. They can go from getting benefits 1 year lose them the next then get them back the following.,hid97sc,comment,2021-10-28T07:25:13,t3_qhb9v1,t1_hibszui,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/qhb9v1/i_wonder_if_this_will_happen_with_bby/hid97sc/,BestBuyWorkers

Some product is price locked and can't get a discount. Others yes they have just removed it completely from which yeah sucks ass.

I would reach out. If they gave you a direct line to contact them I‚Äôd do that or head into the store and speak to them directly (the store phone # redirects to the national line unless they provided you an extension to reach someone).

"So, listen to my story. I was a new hire a few weeks ago. Went in for my first full time day, corporate hadn't sent my ""A number"" over. So I drove 45 minutes back home, this was on a Sunday. Didn't have me come in on Monday. Had me show up for four hours on Tuesday, then didn't schedule me any hours for the rest of the week. In the meantime I found a new job with actual hours and let the district manager know that I found new work due to the lack of hours I was being scheduled. Now I get messages at least twice a week asking if I want to work part time, asking if I'd like a seasonal position and then offering $2+ an hour. Runaway and find something more worth your time.

"New hire during holidays. Missed a monthly meeting.; Alas above. I was told that during holidays the new hires get culled. For instance it's almost Halloween. I've been super nervous about this job, particularly with my direct reporting manager. I'll explain, the only times I've ever showed up late( which was two times in a pretty short span, about 10isj min late) was when she was on shift. Just my luck. Well today apparently there was a mandatory meeting for everybody- I'm sure you guys know it, the monthly training- I read the time as 6 pm to 8 pm instead of AM.

"We can improve our working conditions by working together; Obvious alt is obvious.  &#x200B;  We have some special circumstances this year that have provided us with a particularly great opportunity for the retail workforce. I want to get one rolling for this holiday season.   &#x200B;  Folks, best buy can't hire much more than teenagers and is hemorrhaging labour to places willing to pay more. They don't value us, but they NEED us. They need us for picks. They need us for sales floor. They need us for scheduling and consultation. Our leadership in store cannot help us, they're forced to further exploit us with pressure from corporate. They're forced to rely on us breaking SOP to get jobs done. We're pressured to sacrifice physical and mental well-being for them to scrape whatever extra change they can from our efforts.  &#x200B;  We are all sick of the current situation.  &#x200B;  This holiday season is OUR chance. No more masturbatory claims of being the ""hardest worker,"" no more praying for a fifty cent raise with thrice the responsibility, or getting choked up over an extra dollar an hour with a keyholder position and all of the ridiculous extra responsibilities they want to shove to us from their workload because leadership itself is now understaffed. We've all had it, from front end to the ARAs to mobile to product flow. We just need enough people at enough stores to blackout their profits. They can ignore one store stuttering. They can ignore a store in every region stuttering, but they can't ignore entire service districts going out at once. They can't ignore walkouts during the holiday season. They cannot afford to lose more of us, and to your coworkers that aren't sure where they stand, do they want to be the ones left with the extra workload when we walk out? Do they want to carry the load that corporate will carelessly force on them, demanding their sweat and blood for dimes?  &#x200B;  If you see your team walk out, you walk with them, either in solidarity, or to avoid further exploitation. You must screen yourself from the potential damage, leave with them.  &#x200B;  To the leadership out there that read this, from hourly supes to Operations to GMs, when we're all gone, corporate will put it on you.

"Well, you already applied for whatever position you applied for. If they had an ARA position available you‚Äôd have seen it. It‚Äôs unlikely to get and ARA without already being within Best Buy or Geek Squad. I‚Äôm assuming you applied for a CA position. It is considered entry level and the same pay grade as the majority of the store. The ARA is a higher pay grade. 15-16 is what they probably will give you. Ask for 16 and they may meet you at like 15.50 if you have a great interview.

"Pros:   1: The discount is HELLA nice. Especially on store brand items. But even when a new game comes out, it's usually cheaper to buy it with your discount than a freshly-used copy from GS.   2: You'll usually work with some pretty decent people. I worked in Computers and my team was one of the things keeping me there.   3: Since they raised their starting wage to $15/hr, the pay is alright. I don't know if this is something they did everywhere, though.  Cons:   1: Hours. If you're not full time, you'll be fighting for them.   2: Pressure. Most of your job will be trying to sell extended warranties and the store credit card.

I suspect they went online only because of a lack of inventory which with something this affordable might have lead to *very long lines* and significantly more disappointed people once the small amount each store would have received was doled out.

"CNN Corie Barry interview ""[e]ven as sales are ramping up, Best Buy is seeing a dip in job applications""; [CNN Business - Best Buy CEO: These 4 challenges are why it's hard to hire workers right now](https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/27/economy/retail-workers-child-care-best-buy/index.html)  (article appeared on the front page of CNN.com today, June 1st, 2021)  > Even as sales are ramping up, Best Buy is seeing a dip in job applications  Hey Corie, if you're seeing a dip in job applications, did you ever stop to consider that maybe, *just maybe*, it was because you laid off 5,000 FULL TIME workers and showed the world how you'll fuck over employees for a profit? That would be your fifth reason for the dip in applicants.   I also found this quote hilarious: ""*it's about a wholesome set of benefits that we can put in place*""  Really? What benefits do PT workers get? No medical/dental/vision, no PTO to speak of (but routinely near full-time hours). I guess they can buy BBY stock at a discount in the ESPP program? Wheeeeee.   And when you say ""and flexibility that we can put in place"" it rings more like you want to cut people from 39 hours to 4 hours with little notice, but also want them to come in on their scheduled days off on short notice too. How does this benefit the customer Corie? What is your endgame here? Because customers are likely going to hate having even less experienced employees to have answer their questions, which is what you lost when you cut 5K full timers loose.

"How my management lied to and scammed me.; So I got hired around October at age 16 to pay for my dad's heart surgery and our bills since he was our only income. I worked a steady schedule for 2 weeks, but nobody told me what to do. My co-workers had to help me get my start because management just completely forgot about me. Little did I know, the day I finished my E-Learning and got my blue shirt would be my last day there    I had worked about 8 days up until this point. As mentioned before, this would be the end. The next 2 weeks I had 0 hours scheduled. I had to come in and ask about it because nobody was returning my emails. My hiring manager told me they were cutting hours and things would be back to normal    2 more weeks passed and I still had not been scheduled, and had been informed after emailing my manager that the hour cuts were extended.    Black friday rolled around and I emailed asking if they needed me for black friday. At this point, I still had not been scheduled and nobody was returning my emails at all. About 2 weeks after black friday I came into the location because I was unable to log into the best buy app. I had emailed about this several times with no response. It is then that I found out I had been fired without even being told. The guy who checked the database and found out I was fired had no clue why, he just saw that my info was no longer in the database. I finally got in contact with my manager around January and he said to apply back in March, when they would be hiring again.    I didn't go looking for another job since he assured me that he wanted me back and it wasn't suppose to be like this. I emailed again in February to make sure I was still clear to re apply. He said yes.    Then a week ago after 3 emails, he finally responded asking my age and hours. I said 17 (because my bday had passed) and told him my hours. He responded and said that they want people who can work multiple positions and use equipment, and to wait until I'm 18.     So I had just spent half a year of my life with no income, under the assurance that I would be back to work. And don't forget that I had been secretly laid off, without being told.

"I am not a lawyer, this is not legal advice:  Try to find an employment law attorney that you can get a free consultation with to run your situation by. They should be able to look at what you‚Äôve experienced and determine if there‚Äôs anything actionable. Probably the biggest hurdle to your situation is whether or not any of this is in writing. For the initial hire there should be a paper trail and time sheets should still be available going back that far that an attorney could demand during the discovery phase. That should be able to corroborate your story up to the part where your employment was unexpectedly terminated. The conversations about getting rehired though, assuming they were all on the phone, will come down to your word against theirs. If they tell the truth, great, but if they suddenly have a different recollection it would make proving your case much harder.  Go in with notes, try and remember dates and times as best as possible while they‚Äôre still fresh-ish, and hopefully you can get something done.",gsnsdrp,comment,2021-03-29T02:10:18,t3_mesrs0,t1_gsloenc,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/mesrs0/how_my_management_lied_to_and_scammed_me/gsnsdrp/,BestBuyWorkers

In your situation it seems that they might have been able to avoid some amount of vitriol if they would've just asked people if they would be down to walk away.  Like maybe have a month or two where people could be given info on severance or choosing to change to part-time.  You and others that were wanting/needing to leave would have the chance to do so.  Not sure how many would choose to just leave or change to PT, but would've meant less people would've been purged without warning.  In my department we had at least one guy that was actively wanting to be fired for some reason.  So instead of him just no call no showing and truly fucking us over schedule/appointment wise.  He could've just bounced in a way that actually removed him from our stuff.  Purge might not have been avoided, but maybe it would've.  There are always people that are FT that are getting a FT job somewhere else, but still want to stay on as PT while starting the new job.  Would be kinda win win for some amount of employees.",gph5o1w,comment,2021-03-02T19:00:04,t3_lu2yq7,t1_gp99exz,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/lu2yq7/this_was_from_over_a_year_ago_but_it_is_how_we/gph5o1w/,BestBuyWorkers

Another Circuit City in the making; I was a lucky one and got out last October. I'm sending prayers to all my Blue Shirt family. The company has been going down hill ever since Dick Shultz left. With this last move they are doing just what Circuit City did and that's get rid of those who know what they are doing and replace them with lower paid PT. For those who don't know Circuit was the Best Buy of the East. They owned the market for years and then we moved in.     I was with this company for about 25 years and loved it. I looked forward to going to work. Till the last 5-6 years. Hold your heads up and be proud of who you are. We are the Best and we will sit back and watch the company burn down around Cory and the rest.,lsmfjh,submission,2021-02-25T20:27:50,,,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/lsmfjh/another_circuit_city_in_the_making/,BestBuyWorkers

"Broken Heart; I started working for Best Buy when they first opened in Charlotte, NC. I opened the first store when no one had a clue who we were. Circuit City owned that part of the country. But we were the best. We had loads of fun Being the Best. Managers were able to care. District cared. Corporate cared. It was a great time to be in retail.  If something didn't work we changed it. If it did work we made it better.     The last five years things hit rock bottom. Covid destroyed it. But never would I have thought any of this could happen. I'm a very lucky one. I was offered/forced to take retirement. I knew there was no other options left.    I pray for all of you and know that it will work out and be better in the long term. Be strong. You made this company what is was. Corporate and Wall Street made it what it has become. You made them richer and this is how they said thank you.

"We used to have all our shelves stacked on their sides and nested inside each other instead of hooked into the racking but they were also across from where we kept the food/drink in the warehouse. A rat had gorged itself on chips and candy and died inside all these nested shelves but our supervisor refused to do anything about it for WEEKS. Whenever I'd walk past that area, even for a moment, I'd get nauseated and I was back there a lot as SWAT. Eventually I took it upon myself to basically peel back the layers of shelves until I found the rat. It had been back there so long it was all desiccated and stuck to the floor. I had on multiple masks and pairs of gloves and put it into several bags but the smell almost made our AM full timer hurl when I was booking it to the rear exit to throw the carcass into the woods.

"Oh I definitely think Best Buy workers should make more than the minimum. Especially with them wanting employees to be experts at EVERYTHING. The only truly entry level positions should be truck and front lanes positions, everything else should start higher.   I also think those other jobs should pay more, I think the minimum wage being as low as it‚Äôs been for so long has depressed wages overall. Raising the minimum will force those other salaries up because, as you say, who would do those jobs if they can work anywhere and make $15/hour? The added job security people will have knowing they can make $15 would let people who do make more leave toxic workplaces without having to give up their mortgage for example.

I feel for you though, when I told a co-worker who hasn't had the call yet that some people weren't even given PT as an option they were stunned.

"Nice to see that you added it to guidelines!  The consequences of not having representation seems to be failing our peers that are being let go atm.  It also fails in that they just blame all failings on us, no matter that their decisions are what causes them.  This boot licking of just bending over and taking it that you advise isn't the way that things get better.  Using fear to keep people in line is toxic, demeaning, and unethical.  I refuse to let them keep doing myself and my co-workers so dirty.  All they have to do is ""be human"" and stop abusing us all.  It really isn't hard to just keep in mind that we are people that deserve respect.  They have done shockingly positive things for us workers even just 5 years ago.  So I know it can be done.  What they are doing now is causing burn outs and isn't sustainable given the ways they are cutting staff and effectively making full-timers the same as part-timers with regard to hours.  The way they are going is a great way to make quick money for the top, but will drop hard in the future.  When we are fired because of this, then I fail to see what is worth not doing something.  We will maybe get some small severances, while they will get multi-million dollar ones.  I am guessing that they are trying to somehow be acquired by Amazon with the drastic changes.  If we are being picked off, then we should be coming together and push back.  Believe it or not, I do like the company and want all of us to share in successes that can be had.  Harsh critiques are not always from hate, but many times are because you care and want to make things better.

Great thank you for the info. I am just anxious about getting everything lined up and not skipping a beat in my work schedule.  I just like to have everything ready.  Is there anything I can download to give me more details. So far I have gotten one email at work and then spoke to people in teams. Also can I use teams on my phone? If so what might my login look like?  Sorry to bombard you with questions. And thanks so much for the info.

Hi again :) no worries but no we do not have access to teams on our phones yet. You need to utilize teams as much as possible. Starting today we no longer transfer the way we normally would. There is a UTC for everything now and we need to use breeze for a phone book of those UTC‚Äôs. It‚Äôs pretty cool now when it‚Äôs something we need help with we‚Äôre able to communicate with MODs right away in teams. teams is literally your new life line of being an SCO. All the information for the transition is all on Teams.

Computers are far more difficult to get a payout for. They must be sent out for repair rather than a payout and fall under the lemon policy where it can be sent out up to 3 times for the same problem before considering a junk out/pay out. The device would have to be far beyond repair and not cost effective to be considered a junk out on the first trip. Read the terms of the protection policy closely because the device is only covered under normal use so claiming it fell out of your monster truck and smashed into unimaginable amounts of pieces would not be covered. Also keep in mind the repair process can take weeks per trip depending on how busy it is,gintys4,comment,2021-01-09T10:26:53,t3_ktqdd1,t3_ktqdd1,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/ktqdd1/geeksquad_plan/gintys4/,BestBuyWorkers

And yes, while it sucks, we really shouldn‚Äôt have so many employees.

New employee question; Hey I‚Äôm a new employee at Best Buy (not the one who posted here like a week ago but funnily enough I also work at computing) and just had a question about post elearning. So I am about to finish my elearning and just wanted to know what happens after that and how much Best Buy expects you to have mastered. One thing in really worries about is it all just felt like walls of text where once they talked about one subject they moved on and it was never touched on again. I don‚Äôt know if elearning is just to get familiar with the concepts or if they do expect us to have memorized things like all the different memberships and levels of memberships and cost and customer pickup and all the other things elearning teaches.

Even if you go into the store there is a very high likelihood that not a single employee of that store will know anything about your particular order in this case. Corporate is a shrouded mystery to best buy employees everywhere and they don't really have a good way of informing stores when they are doing exceptions for orders.

"New Hire for Computers Department: Tips?; Hi so I was hired earlier this month for a seasonal position. I've only had about a week or less worth of experience in my department as they're trying to cut down on labor costs. I was placed in the computers department and it is a bit overwhelming. I don't feel pressured or babied by others in my department, I feel comfortable in asking questions. But I have no knowledge of computers so I was wondering if anyone from the department could offer tips or advice on things I should be asking my supervisor about or things I should be told about when trying to help customers. I am a seasonal so I feel stress to impress and learn quickly in order to secure a job during these trying times.   Thank you!

"Try to nail down the general information first, then start learning the details. In my experience customers tend to appreciate folks who can explain WHY you‚Äôd want a more powerful computer, and the biggest one I cite for people is longevity. Even if all you do is browse the web and email, something with a faster processor will tend to add an extra year or two to the total lifespan of the computer.

"Retaliation Prevention Policy: A Former Employee Story; I began my employment at one of Orlando‚Äôs Best Buy stores in 2018. Following a year after, I was sexually harassed by my supervisor in late 2019. After reporting that incident, my employment at Best Buy took the worst of turns.  While the store as a whole could agree that my supervisor‚Äôs overall behavior at work was questionable (just before being promoted as my supervisor, he had been documented for threatening to physically harm a customer.), his sales for the store were competitively high.  My former supervisor had the highest amount of Total Tech Support sales out of all the employees in the store, while his moods were not always pleasant, he was a crucial part of the team since he helped carry the store‚Äôs revenue.  During his short time as my supervisor, he crossed several boundaries which led to his termination. I do want to mention that during the process, the human resources representative assigned to my case during the investigation asked me a question which to this day, I cannot agree with.  *‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you say something sooner?‚Äù*  This question does not feel sincere, but rather similar to an accusation. Talking about sexual harassment, sexual assault, rape, or any misconduct of that matter, is not an easy subject to open up about. Asking why a victim didn‚Äôt rush to speak out feels like a shift of blame. I hope in the future, companies begin to ask more appropriate questions that are more productive to their investigation.  My personal take: Never question the victim‚Äôs motives. If you are curious, here‚Äôs the answer- we are attempting to cope with whatever trauma we were forced to face.  After the termination of my supervisor, different managers began to share with me that the General Manager of the store was no longer fond of me. I was aware that his behavior towards me had changed. I think about the sexual harassment investigation, remembering my GM‚Äôs reaction when he sat next to me during a conference call with human resources.  I told the representative that I had shared with my coworkers the sexual harassment incidents that I had faced. I explained to the representative that I did not feel comfortable with the management at my store, which is why I never came to them. There had been a previous conflict that had occurred in my department which management had not handled professionally.  When I shared this information with the representative, I watched my GM bury his face into the palms of his hands.

"had occurred in my department which management had not handled professionally.  When I shared this information with the representative, I watched my GM bury his face into the palms of his hands. My intention was never to embarrass the GM or the training of his staff, but to express to human resources why I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable confiding in management.  A few days after the termination of my supervisor, I had shared with my GM and the human resources team that I had a concern about an employee who is a family member of my former supervisor. He was a seasonal employee and was had a close relationship with my former supervisor, as they lived together and shared a car. During a casual conversation that I once had with him, he has shared with me that he had been in and out of jail for improper conduct regarding violent behavior.  I shared that conversation with my GM and expressed to him my fear of physical harm or retaliation from this employee. My GM responded to me, ‚Äúhe is seasonal, which means we don‚Äôt have to move forward with him. If I were you, I wouldn‚Äôt worry about it.‚Äù  This had given me peace of mind, until weeks later when I discovered that my GM kept him in the store with a promotion as a full-time employee.  I had felt so deceived by my own General Manager and I no longer felt safe working at the store.  Thinking about the days that followed, my dynamic with my GM changed. He began ignoring me at work. It was very uncomfortable to go into work, walking past each other while making eye-contact, and there being no acknowledgment from him. During some instances, I would be the bigger person and say hello or good morning, but when I did, I was blatantly ignored.  I changed my mindset and accepted that I would come into work to help clients and to stay out of my GM‚Äôs way. There did come a point where I was overwhelmed by how often management was warning me about his growing dislike towards me.  In addition, some of the management would tell me that my GM would persistently ask about my performance. They were told that if I was caught doing something that came remotely close to violating policy, to report the incident to my GM immediately. While this is a fair request, asking management to overlook their staff, why was I being targeted specifically? This had made me feel as if my General Manager wanted to ensure that I was under scrutiny.

"While this is a fair request, asking management to overlook their staff, why was I being targeted specifically? This had made me feel as if my General Manager wanted to ensure that I was under scrutiny.  I‚Äôve always been the person to hear bad news and to stay in a state of shock. I never questioned the management who‚Äôd warned me about my GM. I always nodded my head and absorbed the information, never wanting to continue a conversation about how I was potentially in a hostile work environment. To talk about it, was to acknowledge that it existed.  One day, I developed the courage to ask a manager . . .  Me: ‚ÄúHey, do you know why it is that \[my GM\] doesn‚Äôt like me?‚Äù  Manager: ‚ÄúDid you ever see \[your former supervisor\]‚Äôs numbers?‚Äù  Me: ‚ÄúI guess, but he wasn‚Äôt a good employee, I thought?‚Äù  Manager: ‚ÄúRight, but you reported a problem that brought HR to fly in from out of state. That doesn‚Äôt make \[your GM\] look good in front of HR.‚Äù  After that answer, I knew at that moment that this was never going to end; my General Manager would see it through to have me terminated.  I received a disciplinary action form some weeks after my supervisor‚Äôs termination: a final warning. An employee had come to the store on their day off wanting to exchange a product that had been at an ex-boyfriends house, she had finally been able to retrieve it and wanted to upgrade it to something of a higher quality. I considered that Best Buy‚Äôs management always made exceptions outside of the return/exchange policy for customer satisfaction (this exception is a case-by-case decision).  Considering how I was told to look at out-of-policy transactions (to make exceptions for customers who are willing to spend more money during the exchange process.), I asked a nearby manager if my coworker could exchange an item that was out of policy. After the manager had approved the transaction, I was pulled into the GM‚Äôs office days later signing my first, final warning.  I had pondered for days wondering if having a manager‚Äôs approval still deemed the situation to be a violation of policy. My days of wondering ended soon after I was told that the write up was given solely to ensure that it was on my Best Buy employee record.

"My days of wondering ended soon after I was told that the write up was given solely to ensure that it was on my Best Buy employee record.  One of the managers shared with employees that the GM, being general manager, had the authority to choose the severity of the write-up. Managers shared with employees that my General Manager wanted to ensure that I was put on a final warning.  I had a coworker call me after my shift that day, explaining that they felt that my write up was a form of retaliation. This was an employee who I had not shared any information about my investigation case or how I had been feeling ignored by my GM. However, before ending the call, the employee vowed to report their observations to Best Buy‚Äôs human resources.  I approached my GM the following week asking him to look into transferring me to another Best Buy location, but he never followed up with me as promised.  Months later, I called human resources to finally open up about my fear of retaliation from my General Manager. Human resources took note of my statement and opened a case, but they never reached out to me again after that phone call.  It would be wishful thinking to believe that this is all he-said, she-said, work nonsense. However, after having six different managers in the store confirm that my General Manager had it out for me, wishful thinking would be ignorance.  I am currently a former Best Buy employee. I do wonder at times, maybe if I had stopped my coworkers from making that call to Best Buy‚Äôs human resources department about my sexual harassment concern with my supervisor, I might still work for Best Buy. Perhaps I would‚Äôve had the opportunity to leave on a good note, with the option of having my general manager as a reference for any future work opportunities. But I‚Äôve come to accept that this isn‚Äôt my reality. Best Buy is now a closed chapter of my life.  My purpose for this lengthy reflection is for people to know the truth. The journey to creating a positive work environment for victims who have reported sexual harassment has a long way to go. In a place where I once called my second home, it became the place where I was scared to go to work and where I didn‚Äôt feel the support and acceptance from my management team.  I do not discourage women or men that want to report harassment in the workplace, once it‚Äôs seen through, it can be a sense of relief. However, I strongly urge people to know that in reporting these concerns, there",j5vbke,submission,2020-10-05T20:30:23,,,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/j5vbke/retaliation_prevention_policy_a_former_employee/,BestBuyWorkers

I personally like the benefits of the job especially how they handled the pandemic. As far as the working environment it‚Äôs going to very from store to store and I think depends on the management for each store and for me usually the biggest frustration I have are with the customers. If you are really worried about it maybe you could go to the store and walk around and just kind of see how the employees interact with each other.

I've worked retail for 15 years (Barnes & Noble, Anthropologie, and a few smaller businesses) and Best Buy has given me the best support (for both my career goals and my health issues), most welcoming environment (I am pan and genderfluid), and best pay and flexibility.

"So where did my store go wrong with masks?; Masks are required, as part of company policy and by order of the state my store operates in. From reading other posts in the other sub, it seems most stores have a ‚Äúhost‚Äù who turns away people who try to enter without a mask. Our store has an AP, and even though we‚Äôve never really had issues with shrink/theft, our AP people are just basically doing their usual AP things.   Initially leaders were very hands on with engaging people who made it past AP to let them know they wouldn‚Äôt be assisted if they refused to wear a mask. However, lately they‚Äôre saying employees that are ‚Äúcomfortable‚Äù assisting people without masks may do so. I asked for an SOP or other communication where it said that was an option and nothing was produced.   So... is my store leadership just being greedy and being unsafe on purpose? Or are other stores doing this too? I don‚Äôt feel comfortable helping people without a mask and when I was told we were reopening my GM assured me it would be done safely, but I have a household member who is at risk for this.

"On that $15 minimum; So it‚Äôs a good thing. I‚Äôm glad the entry level workers will get paid fairly out of the gate. That‚Äôs not the problem I have with it, and I‚Äôll never feel bad because someone else is doing better.  That all being said, I do think corporate should have handled the increases for people who are already above $15 that fought to earn their raises better. 4% is pretty weak. It should have been 4% + 1% per year of service up to five years, then an additional 0.5% per year of service up to five years, and finally an additional 0.25% per year of service beyond that (no limit). Someone with ten years would get 11.5%. Someone with fifteen years would get 12.75%. And so on.   And I still think sales associates should have some kind of commission pay. Would it be ideal? No. Would it cause there to be some infighting? Sure. But it‚Äôs not really fair to the really excellent salespeople who crush it on apps and routinely turn out multimillion dollar years to rely on the limited ‚Äúrock star‚Äù raises some leaders dole out.

"Appointment visits; So in principal these sound good, but there have been a number of problems at my location:  1. People going over their appointment time limit (it's in half hour blocks). 2. People being vague in their notes about what the appointment is about (had a customer that came in for a visit in car audio, that ended up adding on some mobile stuff which extended their visit to an hour). 3. Apparently masks are optional for customers. 4. And even though customers are supposed to be hands off, they're still touching things despite being told not to, and that makes the post visit clean up time consuming.  I really wish we required masks though. No medical exceptions (because there aren't any which doctors have freely admitted). We also shouldn't schedule visits towards closing time (when curbside inevitably gets busier). Last appointment should be an hour before close (with the half hour visit ending a half hour before close).  It would also be nice if the scheduler provided a way to block off more time for customers that may need it (I guess you could double book someone to achieve the same effect though).",gin14r,submission,2020-05-12T19:27:51,,,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/gin14r/appointment_visits/,BestBuyWorkers

TL;dr: It's better to apply, file weekly claims and if your state deems you eligible after the fact you may get backdated pay than to not apply at all.",g1upnx,submission,2020-04-15T11:58:37,,,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/g1upnx/unemployment_insurance_info/,BestBuyWorkers

"A new hope; So they say be the change you want to see. And frankly, I've seen so much go wrong over at r/Bestbuy that this latest incident where the sub was locked down (even if for a short while) has made me start this sub for employees (of Best Buy, Geek Squad, and any company or brand owned by those in the United States or abroad) and customers as well.   It's early days, but *the rules will be much more relaxed*.   **I do encourage redditors to use caution as always:** while there may be no rule against something here, the company can and will enforce their rules against you. So be smart: posting a picture of in-store cameras? Black out your store # or anything that could trace it back to you. Have the inside scoop on something? Don't leave your employee ID, name or other details showing in the picture.   And I'm open to help and suggestions: please, leave those below, and if it's something that can be done, I'll see it gets done!

"What almost none of these videos ever do is mention that this is due entirely to corporate mismanagement. Corie cares ONLY about her own nest egg and that of the majority shareholders, who also *just happen to* the be the executive board. All the changes supposedly to ""placate the shareholders"" were made BY those shareholders and all of them are looking to make a windfall when Best Buy is ultimately sold, no matter that the company itself will be basically destroyed.  I've been saying this will happen for years and it is playing out exactly as predicted: Corie hamstrings the stores to drive away customers intentionally so she can close stores to save overhead, but the exaggerated numbers for online sales never materialize and things get worse overall: rinse repeat, and with every cycle Best Buy, gets weaker and smaller. Notice that the most dire company information in that video (and elsewhere) comes from Coire's own reports? That's no accident. She's intentionally killing the company so she and the board can jump with their platinum parachutes when it finally flounders completely and what few workers are left get screwed even more.",jhxjuvg,comment,2023-04-27T11:42:31,t3_12r8ob9,t3_12r8ob9,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/12r8ob9/best_buy_reports_large_scale_store_shutdowns_as/jhxjuvg/,BestBuyWorkers

Well what they did with the GMs was an assignment based on preferences. The DMs got the same treatment.

I fell for their lies once and left services for a couple years to help them run the salesfloor. I got sick of their lies and took a demotion to go back into services.

Negotiating Open Box pricing on Mac Studio @ Best Buy; I‚Äôm a former Best Buy employee from a few years ago. Worked on the sales floor and at Geek Squad as a CA. I know things has changed and one of those changes include how open box prices are generated. It used to be every store had different prices; lowering the price every week it doesn‚Äôt sell. But now they mirror online open box prices. What are the chances I can negotiate the pricing on a Mac Studio M1 Max 512GB open box in my area? It‚Äôs likely not to sell in the area as it‚Äôs not particularly a wealthy or even popular area.  The drive is a hour drive and I don‚Äôt want to drive out there to not be able to get it.,13nu7mm,submission,2023-05-21T09:28:10,,,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/13nu7mm/negotiating_open_box_pricing_on_mac_studio_best/,BestBuyWorkers

"That‚Äôs fair, I don‚Äôt imagine them going any cheaper than that price but it can‚Äôt hurt to ask. Just be careful about showing too much interest in it.

Discount; I am about to reach 4 months and have never used the employee discount. I have nearly saved up to do a high end pc build and was wondering if anyone has bought a graphics card for any significant discount or if one is even available.

Just applied for job...; So I'm only planning on to work for a temporary position for approximately 1 month (until the end of June). Is it totally fine to quit after that as I have to urgently leave the country for something for about 2 months or is there any way I can file a leave of absence and then come back as I intend to continue my employment after I come back? This is going to be my first job so...  Many thanks.,13phox6,submission,2023-05-23T03:48:28,,,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/13phox6/just_applied_for_job/,BestBuyWorkers

I checked a couple of the cards you mentioned and we get a whopping ZERO dollars off.  Traditionally we'd get at least like a $100 off. Doesn't seem to be the case atm.

"Everything everyone says her is true. The reason you are also most likely having a hard time getting jobs in IT is because they are being scooped up by Best Buy, more so geek squad employees because of how bad the direction of the company is. IT Companies like someone who works with customers. Don‚Äôt get me wrong IT knowledge is good and still necessary but soft skills are harder to teach. So when someone who has worked retail and has IT background applies for an IT job they are likely to get it, provided it‚Äôs you know within their capabilities. So yes use this time get about 8 months to a year in and then start applying. For now Best Buy, more so geeksquad still has a decent reputation, but I‚Äôll be honest I feel that is starting to dwindle to the point companies maybe only looking at seasoned employees with several years under their belt.

"As a former manager who has both been the employee transferring AND also been on the hiring side of transfers ‚Ä¶ the application and interview almost don‚Äôt matter.

"Make them not usable, by fire or shredding them.   Before I quit, this guy got ahold of a Best Buy shirt and stole from a store near where I live. The small business got on fb asking if anyone recognized him. If you glanced at the guy, he looked like my gm from Best Buy, except he was covered in tattoos.   Naturally, police came by to question my gm but noticed he did not have tattoos so they want on their way.   Basically, so the shirt does not get in the wrong hands tear it up or burn it up  On my last day, out of respect for the gm I asked if I could tear the shirt.

"I don't want to get into details, but tldr;  Recently (1\~2 years ago so I guess not super recent) promoted to PC DA, started out okay lots of work and I could assist the Appliance dudes when necessary, but following an accident I could no longer assist deliveries, then changes to TT lost us tons of clients, eventually leading to months of little to no work, some days my whole team had several hours between appointments.I complained to our DFM, and he recommended we try and make sales at the store, pull appointments etc, but due to hostility between our local store and field leadership it was difficult to work at the store beyond helping in the precinct. Then following a vehicular accident, wherein I was effectively stuck hours from home, sheltering in a Walmart for 7 hours from extreme weather. After getting home I became disconnected with things and eventually began utilizing my downtime to go home, work off my company laptop, do pre-calls, etc from home, after a while I gave up on trying to pretend to be busy and just procrastinated.  I won't argue that I was justified in wasting company time, as they put it, but transitioning from a 40-50hr work week to maybe 28hrs screwed me over financially, on top of the ongoing physical and emotional burnout from the job.

Am I crazy?; Can we talk about the change in job grades ans caps?   How is it that customer service and sales floor can potentially make more money than SWAT? They have one of the most intense and stessful jobs in the store. Why are they paid as high as a manager or closer to it? Their job is to manage inventory. They technically do PI every day.   Make this make sense.,14a61km,submission,2023-06-15T11:57:26,,,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/14a61km/am_i_crazy/,BestBuyWorkers
I believe this has been a thing for several years now. Advisors were upgraded from pay grade 3 to pay grade 4 when we moved hourly wages to 15. And pay grade 5 was removed when we lost BOL and FEL.  Now I was recently let go from the last restructure (consultant and designer supervisor 12 years) and if something has changed in the last two weeks GS CA/ Advisor/ PFlow/Swat/ VPL are all the same pay grade. The next step up would be a consultant at 9 which is more then an ARA.,jo8voa9,comment,2023-06-15T12:56:29,t3_14a61km,t3_14a61km,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/14a61km/am_i_crazy/jo8voa9/,BestBuyWorkers

"SWAT used to be a higher pay grade at 4 from what I know and a regular pf and sales were 3. All entry level spots got moved to pay grade 4 (Pf, Advisors, VPL, and GS CA)when the company made $15 the minimum.   So SWAT and every other entry level spot are the same. It's not that they make more money by default. In my area, they all max out at $18.22. That is not near what management make unless you get low balled as a manager or supervisor  Personally, I think SWAT should be pay grade 5 due to the fact that they are constantly researching, keeping contact with other stores and the warehouse, and just straight up managing the entire inventory integrity. SWAT is the inventory control leader in its own right. I would never do that job though lol  The next store level positions to get a pay bump currently after getting rid of FEL and BOL would be consultant (pay grade 9), senior consultant (Pay grade 11), GS senior (Pay grade 9), and  GS ARA (Pay grade 8) that is not management",jo8z4hm,comment,2023-06-15T13:20:05,t3_14a61km,t3_14a61km,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/14a61km/am_i_crazy/jo8z4hm/,BestBuyWorkers

"I like the way you think. SWATs should easily be equal to or greater than Supervisors easily and the fact they havent increased the pay cap is a joke. Even after they raised everyone to the $15minimum still didnt increase cap. People dont realize that without a SWAT properly doing their job, the sales floor has nothing to sell.

"No, it‚Äôs not wage theft. I know it‚Äôs frustrating but you need to lookup what that actually means before making assumptions.

"After 12 years as an Agent, my time has come.; After working for this company for 12 years, more than 11 of which was as a Car Audio Technician, I've been forced out. I was told to move to a store with a 45 minute commute compared to my 4 minute commute, and with absolutely zero incentives. ""You have two weeks left here, then you will move all your appointments to that store, and train two very green technicians. You are responsible for dragging a failing install bay out of the mud, and into success, like the bay you run now.""  ""Uh, no. I will not do that, I like having a short commute. But let's say I do agree, what are you offering me to do this? This is a LOT more work than I have now, and a much longer commute. Surely you plan to incentivise me somehow, right?""  ""No, you are at cap, we cannot offer you a raise. Ever, actually. The next time you are up for a raise, we will calculate how much money that would add to your annual pay, and give it to you in a lump sum. So, you will get nothing right now.""  ""Yeah, no. Like, HELL no. I am underpaid as it is. If you won't compensate me, and I have to commute anyway, then I will find someone who WILL compensate me. I'll have a new job in the next couole days, in fact. You do not realize how valuable I am. This is a really stupid move. Best Buy doesn't realize how lucky they are to have me as it is.""

But only if I was stipid enough to accept. I will have a new job before I work at that location. I will not work a single day there, just you watch.""

"You and Caty have amazing potential, and I would have loved to train you both, if Best Buy had just given me *anything* to make that worthwhile. I feel terrible that you are on your own now, and even more terrible knowing that help and support from Best Buy is definitely not coming, considering I offered that over and over, only to be repaid like this. That bay is definitely failing, but let me be clear, that is *not* your fault. At all. That is 100% on the upper management of the company. You haven't been given the tools you need to even have a chance to truly succeed. If you do manage to pull that bay out of the mud, it will be completely your own doing, not because of the company.  My advice is, if you do manage to find success at Best Buy, leave the moment a good opportunity comes your way. Use that store to teach yourself new skills, and grow as an installer. Then, when you've started to really get a handle on things, jump ship. Best Buy will not hesitate to screw you over, if you are in the way, so don't stay out of a false sense of loyalty, like I did. Use Best Buy to get a step up in life, and don't get stuck.

The manufacturers are very specific that TVs are transported vertically, even by the consumer.  It is pretty obvious, just by looking at the screen, how the damage happened.  It's one of several reasons the protection plans do NOT cover physical damage to a TV.  As a customer, if you are within the return period, you can go to the store (customer service desk) and ask.  It will be up to the store if they will accept the return or not.

Same for any department store: Costco, Microcenter, etc.  So when a laptop is $300 off MSRP, best buy isn't taking that price hit, the OEM is.  **With that said, consider this example.**  A $1200 asus laptop might give an employee discount of $150($1050 after).  However, If it goes on consumer-facing sale for $900, typically, you lose your employee discount.  Remember, however,¬†the OEM facilitated the sale. which is important, because BEST BUY is still making the same margin off of the new total of $900.   Basic math below:   \- $1200 MSRP with a best buy margin of 25% = **$240 gross profit**   \- $900 MSRP with best buy margin STILL at 25% = **$180 gross profit**  So, when sales happen, and we lose our discounts, which happens very often, it's hard not to be bitter at Best Buy. They seemingly strip an employee discount out of the picture while avoiding the PR hit.  Am I wrong here? This practice seems contrary to valuing employees. I was in distributor sales for quite some time and know how this stuff works for most types of markets (food, wine, cars, furniture).",14mdjt5,submission,2023-06-29T15:10:19,,,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/14mdjt5/ramblings_about_employee_discounts_a_fake_example/,BestBuyWorkers

"There are contracts with the OEM that will guarentee X% margin no matter what the price is.

In other words there is a buy down price.

Shift leads; How's it working out for you so far?,14mdbfa,submission,2023-06-29T15:01:22,,,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/14mdbfa/shift_leads/,BestBuyWorkers
"It has been a mixed bag at our store.  One thing I like is it has helped out with coverage, which was my first concern with lay-offs. Shift leads can help open/close the building, which allows ""name-tag"" leaders to work during customer hours. I used to have to spend 4-5 hours hosting and engagement leading, whereas now I can spread that time amongst the shift leads and use that time to coach and train.  I also like that it is encouraging our employees to make decisions on ""basic"" MOD calls. So for example, does a supervisor or above really need to answer the ""Can I get an MOD to front lanes for a return question?"" When its for an opened product 3 days outside the return window. Like, y'all should know the policy, make a decision.   However, I do have concerns that the company has lowered the threshold to obtain keys and alarm codes.  There's also a lot of mixed messaging around shift lead expectations. I just got off a teams call where our marketplace AVP warned us to stop calling shift lead a position, and to refer to it as a task. ""Our shift leads are not supervisors."" And he's not wrong - it's not a job code. It's a task in TLC. But then he, our market HR, and my marketplace director (GM) turn around and list off all the things they want from our shift leads, and all of them sound very supervisory   This has caused tension amongst current shift leads. In the past, I was able to leverage the work I did as SWAT, for example, to get promoted. No one was paying me for the MOD calls I took as a non-leader. But now we are paying them for their shift lead work. And we're paying them like shit for it. So it's caused the issue where if we so much as ask ""hey can so and so shadow you today"" we get ""oh I'm not coded shift lead today so no.""  We don't want to abuse their help - like, yes they should get paid for leadership tasking - but it does bring up a lot of questions about personal brand and how you are supposed to carry yourself.  So, still some stuff to figure out as a store in terms of how we execute this",jq1vbzp,comment,2023-06-29T17:57:17,t3_14mdbfa,t3_14mdbfa,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/14mdbfa/shift_leads/jq1vbzp/,BestBuyWorkers

"Your AVP is absolutely wrong, tell him to look at the shift lead expectations that just came out. Its a two page document that has shift leads doing pages of supervisor duties to include interviewing seasonal job applicants. And it most definitely is a ""job code"". I've been a keyholder for over 3 years now as a part-time employee. Just hit 9 years of my second stint with bestbuy, my employee number is only 6 digits and my first hire date was 2004. In any event, I've only been a keyholder in my new store since October. Every month I was a keyholder in my previous store my POS access had to be reset from the lowest to highest so I could open/close registers and do overrides. Since they changed it to shift lead in the system my stuff does not reset like it used to, so in my experience it tells me that it's a job code.",jq3787m,comment,2023-06-30T00:17:16,t3_14mdbfa,t1_jq1vbzp,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/14mdbfa/shift_leads/jq3787m/,BestBuyWorkers

"Well yes, that's part of the ""leveling up."" Right after he gave that warning, someone else presented a slide about the responsibilities shifting down.  But it's not a job you apply for. You can't put a job posting for ""shift lead"". It's just e-learning certifications that allow me to schedule someone in shift lead tasking.  It's a technicality that allows the company to avoid admitting  they expect everyone to do more work for less pay.    So you get things like my AVP and MD going ""we're not giving more work, just spreading out responsibilities"" but then my MD turns around and says ""Maybe we get to a point where shift leads are doing QCs, interviews, and writing schedules""",jq4mggv,comment,2023-06-30T09:35:48,t3_14mdbfa,t1_jq3787m,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/14mdbfa/shift_leads/jq4mggv/,BestBuyWorkers

Samsung's OLED tvs are QDOLED made by Samsung display. LG display makes standard WOLED panels.  Sony as of right now buys from both LG display and Samsung display. With the A80K and A90j/k being LG panels and the sony A95K and soon to be A95L using the Samsung QDOLED. A80k/A90j/k use the same panel as the LG C2 A95K is the same panel as S95B A95L will be the same panel as the S95C Lgs G3 OLED will feature similar brightness minus some color volume to the two but will be using their own unique MLA panel.  This is the only correct answer.  Edit: There might be a circumstance I could see where LG merely supplied Samsung with the OLED tech but Samsung still has to turn that OLED into a QDOLED since if you go more in depth they're the same type just structured differently with coatings and subpixels and quantum dots and blah blah blah now we are into a different subject entirely.,jqck47z,comment,2023-07-02T01:18:32,t3_14odcg2,t3_14odcg2,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/14odcg2/settle_this_debate/jqck47z/,BestBuyWorkers

I'm no expert but LG has the G3 which uses MLA which is LG answer to Sony and Samsungs QD-OLED because the didn't invest into QD OLED. MLA does get the G3 really bright tho which is why it's in the comparison with the S95C and A95L  LG G3 is not a QD-OLED LG does not make one.   Side note Samsung does not consider the S95C as their flagship tv either so many experts believe it's full capabilities are being held back  S95C is too expensive imo I'd go for the G3 but damn the S95B is probably best price to performance tv we've seen in a while. The No Dolby vision for the S95 is a turnoff but a lot of reviewers say the difference is a non factor for most  Editing cuz I release you also asked about panels MLA are LG panels   QD-OLED are Samsungs own panels,jqck6qn,comment,2023-07-02T01:19:23,t3_14odcg2,t3_14odcg2,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/14odcg2/settle_this_debate/jqck6qn/,BestBuyWorkers
"From everything I've seen and read, this is a true quantum dot OLED manufactured by Samsung Display. LG has nothing to do with this tech as Samsung Display is using a different subpixel layout for their screens compared to what LG has produced.   As to Sony, I believe they procure most of their OLED panels from LG, but I believe their QD panel is from Samsung. This I'm far less certain on, as I don't keep up with the stories around Sony.  But as far as the S95C is concerned, it is a Samsung Display and a true QD-OLED. I also think Samsung has a superior offering: in addition to the better display tech because of QD-OLED, I strongly dislike any display that has a hardwired power cord. Why LG does this with most of their OLED TVs is beyond me. That Samsung has not just a detachable power cord, but also a One Connect box, puts them way in front of what LG is offering.",jqclh8c,comment,2023-07-02T01:34:49,t3_14odcg2,t3_14odcg2,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/14odcg2/settle_this_debate/jqclh8c/,BestBuyWorkers
"Long answer here...  Samsung Display and LG Display make OLED panels. They are separate from Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics. Think of them more like sister companies.   LG Display makes WOLED (also called WRGB, the emphasis is on the W meaning a white subpixel is added). Up until last year, that was the only panel available, and Sony (and others) used LGs panel in their OLEDs.   LG Display's goal is to sell as many panels as possible, so they actually loved Sony and others buying their panels. When Sony started winning the King of TV Shootout over LG, they didn't care because it was still Display's panel. Of course LG Electronics wasn't happy about it üòú.  Samsung Electronics firmly supports QLED as the premier tech and NOT OLED (even the QD variety). They have been very vocal in their anti-OLED stance. But they are affected by changes to their sister company Samsung Display.  Samsung Display used to make only LED panels. But LED panel production has slowly been shifting to China as Chinese companies can make them much cheaper. No one wants to buy a Chinese tv, but no one realizes where the panel in their tv comes from, so manufacturers are going to go with the cheapest panel available that performs to the required specs.   That means Samsung Display knew they had to get out of the LED panel business. Enter QD-OLED. They shifted to producing QD-OLED panels last year with really poor results to start. When they first were producing them, they had about a 30% yield (only 3 out of 10 panels survived the process). However, by the end of the year that number flipped to like 75% which was an incredible turnaround.   Sony saw the potential in QD-OLED and bought in almost immediately, which is very unlike Sony, who usually does not buy in on brand new technology. Samsung Electronics still wanted no part in OLEDs though, so they would not make a QD-OLED at first. Speculation here, but the thought is eventually the Samsung parent company stepped in and forced SSE to buy the panels from SSD or else SSD would have had difficulty not going under.   While the QD panels were being developed, LG was working on the MLA panel. Completely different technology, but one that can get brightness equivalent to that of QD (although colors still aren't at the WD level).  For this",jqdngh8,comment,2023-07-02T09:28:21,t3_14odcg2,t3_14odcg2,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/14odcg2/settle_this_debate/jqdngh8/,BestBuyWorkers
"While the QD panels were being developed, LG was working on the MLA panel. Completely different technology, but one that can get brightness equivalent to that of QD (although colors still aren't at the WD level).  For this year, the end result is LG will use LG Display's WOLED and MLA panels for their lineup. The 55, 65, and 77 G3 will use MLA, everything else will use the traditional WOLED panel (of which there are a couple of variations). This includes the 83"" G3 which will not be MLA (MLA panel not available in that size yet).  Sony will use the LG's WOLED in the A80L (all sizes), and Samsung's QD-OLED in the A95L.  Samsung will use their QD-OLED panels in their S90C and S95C. They are also probably going to have a WOLED model later this year with an LG Display panel.   Quick explanation of panels... OLED is inherently a dimmer technology, so it's all about getting the best color while maintaining brightness. Very simple explanation here, but WOLED uses a white subpixel, then filters it to make Red/Green/Blue light. This filtering process removes energy/brightness from the light, so white light is then reintroduced to brighten the image.   MLA uses tiny lenses to amplify the light and make it brighter, leading to a brighter picture and potentially less white light needed to brighten the picture.   QD-OLED uses quantum dots, which rather than filter light actually transforms light to the color of the crystal used. The panel started with blue light (the strongest wavelength of R/G/B) and then either passes the blue light straight through or hits the Red or Green quantum crystal. The energy from the blue light activates the crystal which gives off its corresponding color. You get bright colors without introducing white.   WOLEDs look great, but there is a slight whitewashing of colors (particularly reds). If that's all you've ever seen you would never even realize it. A QD-OLED makes much more vivid reds and can even produce shades or reds that have never been displayed on a tv before. When you watch demos on the A95 or S90/95, pay attention to the reds.   Theoretically the MLA should be able to do better colors too since the lenses allow less reliance on white",jqdngh8,comment,2023-07-02T09:28:21,t3_14odcg2,t3_14odcg2,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/14odcg2/settle_this_debate/jqdngh8/,BestBuyWorkers

So I was reading over the severance agreement and it says that if I‚Äôm rehired by Best Buy or by a third party company that provides services to Best Buy I might have to pay back some of the severance pay.  Does anyone know if the severance pay starts right after I got laid off? Or from when the severance packet gets signed and processed?

"There's a full guide within the warehouse section of SOP for processing soda stream canisters.

The problem is that people destroy the box lose the canisters or deface the outbound labels for shipping it out.   Problems arise from people just putting them in the recycling area, Gaylord, hazardous waste bins in the warehouse or trying to PRC them.   Like I said.... lack of training or willingness to learn.  If people buy them outright they pay full price, if they do an exchange they get them for half price I think or a % off of a new one.

"Restructuring to Micromarket; The micromarket Company restructure was piloted for about 2 years in NY and essentially became the company  gold standard... The idea is simply put as so - the micromarket would work like one big store (how SWAS was before) however resources are deployable from the Hub store (hence why Hub stores have the most headcount and generally the best of the best)... If a micromarket has 3 stores, picture those 3 stores as 1 big store - that's the idea behind the cuts and deployable labor from the hub store - in so many words, it's like a ""loyalty 1"" but to another store vs another department... From this perspective, you don't need 3 GSMs but 1 Services experience manager (the best GSM supposedly) to run this ""big store"" or MM and the other 2 GSMs would get cut... Evaluations were made based on personal ranking submitted to GM, GM rankings of leaders submitted to MM director (also the hub store GM but not really - they are like a DM of their MM but do have the Hub store as their home location) and then ""in partnership"" with AVP (Marketplace manager, more to come) and HR and 3rd party company (DEI/ESG) - decisions were made on who would stay and who would leave... How those decisions were made were never explained to the individuals getting severance so that was essentially a mystery except to the parties involved in the decision making... Many stores were left in complete shock at who was retained and how the leaders were let go (basically, the leaders were scheduled to work and during their shift, they were given the scripted speech with their severance information, hopes of roles popping open soon in JOS, and being walk out the building without telling anyone what just happened and not being able to say bye to their teams). The main concern with the scheduled sit down severance speeches were to ensure that ""GMs got the store keys back to prevent having to rekey the buildings"" - as far as how the leader felt or having an opportunity to speak to anyone, that was placed at 0% priority or concern.  The Micromarket restructuring started about a year ago and I may have missed a few areas however, in general, this is pretty accurate.   Corporate: many mergers and cuts occurred there as well, I don't have too many details as that was outside of my wheelhouse however, it was very impactful",153ukht,submission,2023-07-19T09:07:30,,,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/153ukht/restructuring_to_micromarket/,BestBuyWorkers
"may have missed a few areas however, in general, this is pretty accurate.   Corporate: many mergers and cuts occurred there as well, I don't have too many details as that was outside of my wheelhouse however, it was very impactful when I was informed.  Territory, Market, District: essentially all of those leaders and their staff were absorbed into a ""Marketplace"". A marketplace is like 3-4 districts from a legacy perspective (which was like 2 markets to go a little further) and managed by an AVP (assistant Vice President)... So obviously, there were a lot of cuts from the territory, market and district levels (many of those leaders saw the writing on the wall and left beforehand)... Many went the corporate route or multichannel/unit route or home services route (as remote work was and still is overemphasized and overresourced however, still pretty safe in comparison to employees inside 4 walls) and then the rest were simply laid off... Many hundreds of years of tenure gone down the drain.  Field Agents: Essentially cut in half, this happened like a week ago around independence day.  Precinct: GSMs cut (there is one Services Experience manager per micromarket now in store and some stores have a services supervisor but not all).   Sales: all ASMs cut in half (with the exception of one Hub store per micromarket which may have 2-3 ASM - experience managers as they are called now, will be responsible and accountable for both Sales and Ops and will have a few weeks to learn the ropes). All SSMs cut whether appliances, connected, mobile, etc - they generally got absorbed into the Sup staffing headcount... Sups cut down to 2 or 3 maximum per store with 1 possibly being services supervisor for GSP (again, not every store had this Staffing Headcount - some stores got rid of GSM and the Senior is running the show in partnership with MM services experience manager). From sales, it's safe to say that at least 50% of the leaders were laid off (if you go from the furlough days of pandemic - you can say that 50% advisors have been cut since then as well although, this was not part of the micromarket op model) and what was replaced was a bucket of 40 hours per week per store of labor in leadership bucket for shift leads... If a store has 6 shift leads for example, each will get ""up",153ukht,submission,2023-07-19T09:07:30,,,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/153ukht/restructuring_to_micromarket/,BestBuyWorkers
"was not part of the micromarket op model) and what was replaced was a bucket of 40 hours per week per store of labor in leadership bucket for shift leads... If a store has 6 shift leads for example, each will get ""up to"" 7 hours of Shift lead pay per week - some more than others depending on how many managerial tasks/duties they are assigned... Shift leads are essentially supposed to be your ""cream of the crop"" talent (although many stores were amateurishly handing out the position like candy on Halloween - how we used to do with backup VPLs in the past - and now are battling an uphill battle with the selections they made)... The way it should work is that SL get scheduled that labor ""activity"" (as it is not a Job Code per se but more of a skillset you schedule like you would a ""monthly training"" or ""new hire"") after being certified via elearnings and leadership approval in Learning Network... Those SLs should have been the best hourly line level employees and essentially were runner-up for Sup roles or what have you... The problem that is occurring in store now is that, there is a nudge coming from leadership that basically states the following ""a SL performs managerial duties when scheduled; a good SL performs managerial duties when needed; a great SL performs managerial duties at all times"" - the conflict arises when these SLs forget that they still have to contribute to store Performance and Look and Feel causing a ""power trip"" effect and fellow advisors getting upset at their high horse syndrome... Some more intelligent veteran SLs say, ""I will only perform key calls, overrides, MOD resolutions, etc while I'm being paid as SL"" because they are aware that there would be no promotional opportunity any time soon... This will by far be the greatest hurdle for the company as many of these veteran advisors working as SLs are not ""drinking the juice"" and feel that the company cut a plethora of leaders yet the job still remains to complete - end result, the SL must perform and/or verify the task completion for lesser pay than previous Sups and without the name tag title to go along with... Obviously, this causes conflicts among advisors who are not SLs as jealousy or envy or even misunderstanding of the SL role causes internal discomfort and conflicts.  Product flow: essentially now a team which are led by shift leads (on a daily basis however, the EM for each",153ukht,submission,2023-07-19T09:07:30,,,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/153ukht/restructuring_to_micromarket/,BestBuyWorkers
"causes conflicts among advisors who are not SLs as jealousy or envy or even misunderstanding of the SL role causes internal discomfort and conflicts.  Product flow: essentially now a team which are led by shift leads (on a daily basis however, the EM for each store in partnership with GM and MM director could make a Sup in charge of Ops but not company directive). The traditional daily tasks, Merch, plano, Swat, Truck, etc are all merged into a bucket of labor now - there isn't a direct leader in the warehouse per se simply some SLs unless a MM decides to use a Sup for Ops (highly unlikely yet, some do have a process or Specialty Coach that may be utilized for ""setting direction"" in the MM)... As in the sales floor dilemmas, PF probably has much more as things like Truck night are being led by an able bodied advisor yet, they may back off the actual physical labor and ""manage"" the truck team the whole night... The ""too many chiefs, not enough Indians"" conflict arises (just as it does on the Sales floor) and many of the SLs have slim to no experience in actual people leading to diffuse the conflicts and create reasonable solutions... Again, the greatest issue will be getting the SL program under control as many may confuse the job activity with the job title and feel empowered to believe they are no longer required to roll their sleeves up and work.  Outcome - apparently, NY micromarket stated that it took quite some time to get it figured out but that they love it now... I can say this was said to me by a few GMs when I was doing training with them (they kept winning on many of the scorecards at the time and it sparked my curiosity)... Turnover is expected of course and as cold as that may seem, it's actually calculated and even taken into account with salary compensation for those employees moving forward.  Many are not in favor and feel that these changes and restructurings are occurring so quickly that uncertainty and employee morale are at an all time low... These changes including the changes that occurred with Total Tech (TTS, TT, MBBYTotal, etc) are all signs of amateur leadership from the top or signs of potential financial distress - definitely not well organized or thorough...

"I‚Äôd like to clear up how bonuses work for you guys.  Source: former SSM under the bonus structure l. I‚Äôm an inhome agent now.  Best Buy manager bonuses has three components - Revenue, Operating Income, and Shared Success. They used to all be weighted a third but I believe it‚Äôs like 40/40/20 now.  Memberships are profitable and help with OI, but there is no bonuses for hitting membership goals. Bad leaders don‚Äôt explain the WHY of membership.  The strategy is that with the card it gives them more buying power to get all the services and accessories (Rev and OI) and with Plus and Total is incentivized repeat business. (Which is why you should be hearing about relational customers vs transactional customers in your coaching)  But there has never been a bonus for memberships but memberships are the leading indicator of hitting Rev and OI.  Shared success is a mystery metric though. It‚Äôs basically the part of your bonus that when the big bosses get to bonus, you get some too.

So effing sick of management with daily check in; Every fucking day as u clock in they look at ur numbers telling you what you should work on like how many bps or membership or revenue u can get for the day try to get triple green as if they wouldnt replace you regardless as we‚Äôve seen with the firing of achievers and others who have done well. I am absolutely fed up when im mentally stressed by the constant stupidity of everything and being told to get something that i have no power over as if they think i dont pitch it plus the shadowing of managers are even more infuriating‚Ä¶i am praying someone calls me for an interview as i keep throwing my resume to anywhere but best buy,158xm55,submission,2023-07-25T00:28:29,,,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/158xm55/so_effing_sick_of_management_with_daily_check_in/,BestBuyWorkers
100% agree with you.  These daily check-ins do nothing but put more stress on employees. Something that always baffled me about these as well is management will tell you to not see a customer as another number (ex. not see a customer as membership #5 etc.) yet that‚Äôs exactly what these check-ins do lmao.,jtchvif,comment,2023-07-25T00:57:01,t3_158xm55,t3_158xm55,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/158xm55/so_effing_sick_of_management_with_daily_check_in/jtchvif/,BestBuyWorkers

"Managers, sups and shit leads look at customers as credit card apps. Not customers who need help or customers that are just browsing, or have a technical question......you the customer are a walking talking credit card app. Nothing more, nothing less. The staff will ignore them if they're not getting a credit card, but will break their backs if they say ""yes, I'd like a best buy credit card"". The amount of chatter about apps on the radio the whole day is mind numbing and depressing.  Shopping in other best buys as a customer sometimes where I'm unknown, it's clearly a company issue. Not yet a singular store's issue. It's a toxic culture.

"I start with the plus. First looking to see if whatever they‚Äôre buying or considering to buy offers member deals. I call it a 60 day price match policy and explain we run sales every week and chances are the item they‚Äôre buying might go on sale within the two months. Also show member deals on my phone that they will get if they become a member and how it‚Äôs update almost daily. I bring up total if we start talking about protection or services to be done.   By the way this is all done while talking to them about products and brought up early. Don‚Äôt mention price of the membership unless they ask. You‚Äôll find your own way to pitch it but once you get it down, it‚Äôs not that hard. I‚Äôm pushing Plus way more than total. When you pitch both of them at the same time, customers get lost and stop caring.",jtexe2s,comment,2023-07-25T14:01:12,t3_159fm06,t3_159fm06,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/159fm06/how_are_you_guys_pitching_the_new_my_best_buy/jtexe2s/,BestBuyWorkers
"The two biggest differences between the two are the free in store services and the included protection plan. Asking questions like ‚Äúdo you shop here a lot?‚Äù And ‚Äúdo you usually buy warranties on your devices?‚Äù is a great way to break the ice on getting into the membership conversation. Me personally I like to find a specific item they‚Äôre looking for before getting into any of that talk and I‚Äôll give you a example. Greet customer , pull up their account. ‚ÄúHey David I see you‚Äôre not a cardholder or member with us , just to let you know all of our laptops currently are 0% interest for 12 months if you wanted to take advantage of that, we also do have some great membership benefits but I‚Äôll get into that a little more later‚Äù. You find laptop they want. ‚ÄúGreat choice, I do have a couple more questions, do you plan on buying a protection plan for this laptop?‚Äù Are you going to be needing a data transfer from your old device to this new one?‚Äù If they answer yes to those you should SHOW them the $179 membership, we are visual beings, SHOW them the savings , ‚ÄúI did briefly mention about membership benefits and I do believe our $179 membership is going to be fantastic for you, along with included protection up to 2 years on this device and majority of other items you buy all of our in store services are free meaning we can transfer your data to your new device for free, how does that sound?‚Äù  If they yes great! Briefly go over the extra benefits like 60 day return policy and member pricing . If they aren‚Äôt interested that‚Äôs where you ask them if they shop here a lot, and SHOW them our member deals in the app or ssk(when it works ha ha). If they seem interested that‚Äôs where you mention the $49.99 membership . In general if I can find a laptop/tv on a membership price that fits the specs and needs of the customer I tend to bring them to that specific sku first because if they aren‚Äôt interested in total it‚Äôs much easier to transition into plus because most of the time that member price pays for the membership on the initial purchase.",jtf1u6q,comment,2023-07-25T14:29:03,t3_159fm06,t3_159fm06,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/159fm06/how_are_you_guys_pitching_the_new_my_best_buy/jtf1u6q/,BestBuyWorkers

"Getting cucked; I‚Äôve been with Best Buy since November of last year, and before the snap I got bumped to shift lead with the promises of great things to come(like everyone else) mainly me being full time, but that never happened. It kept on going to other people of our ‚Äúregional manager‚Äù said we couldn‚Äôt have anymore full time. So I was the only non-full time shift lead. I got my codes and my keys and it made my life easier. But I noticed every other shift lead was getting their hands held and helped along the way, allowed to go do manager things and just be treated better. But for me, when I said I‚Äôd go do an override, or try to take care of a angry customer I got told no, I‚Äôve gotten zero support on the floor. Plus I kept getting yelled at by our ASM to ‚Äúdo better or something going to change.‚Äù Before my ‚Äúpromotion‚Äù he never talked to me like that, i used to average 25 bps and 20 Tt‚Äôs a month, but since the change I‚Äôm at 10 and 8 currently. It‚Äôs been hard for everyone in my store.   But I got sick of getting treated differently than the rest so I gave my keys back and said I‚Äôm not doing it anymore. That was a week and a half ago. Now all of a sudden I went from 35-39(I wanted full time for the benefits and extra pay. I know I was getting full time hours.

"HOT TAKE: Middle Eastern Customers; Before I get started this is not a rant on anyone's race or ethnicity.  This is about something that I've recognized over and over again throughout my years of retail, mostly at Best Buy.     We already know that Middle Eastern customers always ask for a ""DISCOUNNNNNNNT"" but the one thing I can't stand about them is their indecisiveness.  They come in all the time in the last few minutes before the store closes, setup orders for items then as soon as the transaction is processed they change their mind and want to buy something different.  It's ALWAYS a Middle Eastern customer that changes their mind at the very last second, then has to debate which one to get with one of the 7 family members they go into the store with.

"Lack of retention; So I‚Äôve been working for Best Buy for a couple months now. I don‚Äôt mean to sound like a showboat, but this will help my overall point: I was the top salesman last month and am on track to do even better numbers this month, all in my first three months.  Im an occasional/seasonal employee, and yet my employer is giving me full time hours. Im hitting overtime this week and next week, and by no means am I complaining. But something I‚Äôve noticed is that they‚Äôre cutting hours on employees that have been here for years. A full time employee is receiving 25-30 hours to cut labor hours and im receiving 38+ each week.  While I understand that this is a ‚Äúperformance based position,‚Äù my colleagues have seemingly bashed me for undermining their hours when all im doing is my job. In my first three months, I‚Äôve seen full timers leave because of labor cuts, not just on the sales floor, but product flow just as much.  Best Buy really needs to work on incentivizing with their employees better.  At this rate, I‚Äôd have much better pay at an actual commission based job and probably be appreciated more.

"I would go with LG, and here's why. I was a Home Theater Agent that did repairs on TVs. The number one TV I hated going out to fix was Sony. Especially if we had to deal with the factory warranty and put up with their bullshit. We would do a triage, and that wouldn't fix the TV all the time. Then, they would send part after part  until it was past 30 days or if the cost was BER (Beyond Economical Repair) on their end. Before I left, a poor elderly client was still waiting to get his Sony tv replaced after almost 3 months of multiple agents trying to fix it, but Sony wouldn't replace it. Sony's are great when they work, but after having to deal with them for 5 years on repairs and the headaches they have given us and clients. I refuse to buy a Sony TV. I would rather buy myself an LG OLED any day. It is much easier to deal with and easy to fix. I also didn't have to repair a lot of them. Samsung, I did repair the most, but those repairs are not a problem at all. They were the easiest to repair, but like I said, they do get serviced a lot. If you're going to get a Sony, then get the GSP plan. The process through the Geek Squad was simpler than the factory warranty but still a pain in the ass to fix. Sorry for the paragraph. I can say a lot more, but I bet no one is reading this far.  TL:DR - Sony is a pain in the ass to deal with for this repair agent.",jw3qxul,comment,2023-08-13T22:37:32,t3_15qii74,t3_15qii74,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/15qii74/best_tv_brand/jw3qxul/,BestBuyWorkers

"Sony is great but they have their own rare issues. Lg makes a great OLED and some nice LEDs but I think Samsung and Sony fair better on the LED side of things. Even their flagship the qned85 is nice, I think most of our customers would be quite happy with the picture quality. But Samsung and Sony LED's are just more impressive to me. Even if you set all 3 to their respective filmmaker mode. Samsung has a lot of brand loyalty in my area and we do capitalize. Hell I got Samsung's. I've heard they have more failure's and seeing how many people complain is kinda how we would know about a failure rate. But I've also seen LG and Sony have failures pretty bad. If asked I'll tell them that, probably has a higher failure rate, but I don't think the risk differential is all that great. Definitely a compromise tv for me. But a pretty damn good one on the high end. But this year even their low end it pretty good. I think the cu7000 is actually a little impressive in the shadows and a decent brightness for a crystal uhd. Likewise from the x77l from Sony.  Lg uq series tv's look bland by comparison on the low end and their qned ain't quite as nice on the high end. Tcl and hisense came out swinging with the qm8 and u8 tv's but my store doesn't have those to display. Only the cheaper ones. Which still provide a good value for what they are but I know they would sell like crazy if people could see them. Stick mostly to Sony and Samsung   Also I'm constantly triggered by tizen",jw3vqfx,comment,2023-08-13T23:34:08,t3_15qii74,t3_15qii74,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/15qii74/best_tv_brand/jw3vqfx/,BestBuyWorkers

"I personally have a preference for LG, however having a go to brand is flawed sales tactics.  It gives off strong used car salesmen vibes. Or worse, ‚ÄúI get incentives on this brand so buy this one‚Äù. A little research and you‚Äôll find it entirely depends on the customers wants and ‚Äúneeds‚Äù. While Samsung makes the best brightroom TV, Hisense makes a wonderful midrange contender. LG dominates on the OLED side but not every category because LG has a wildly varying range of good, better, and best both Samsung and Sony have good contenders. Samsung has more service calls because they almost out sale at a 2 to 1 ratio over all the other brands. But if you look at percentages they are all pretty close to each other in terms of sales to service.  And if the customer is that concerned about needing a service call or wants more comprehensive coverage that‚Äôs literally why Best Buy has the gold standard in warranty. Especially right now, because of such an aging market more often that not the older models have a better price to quality ratio that makes it hard to get a 2023 version of TV.",jw4q4lz,comment,2023-08-14T05:26:02,t3_15qii74,t3_15qii74,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/15qii74/best_tv_brand/jw4q4lz/,BestBuyWorkers

"Not quite a Sony OLED owner but I see you asked twice and I feel I have some insight. I got an S95B demo for a scorching deal. But I've spent a lot of time with the Sony's. They are probably the least bright OLED right now. But I'd say they are suitable for any room where blinds can be drawn. Ideal for darker spaces.  Sony prioritized accuracy of intent more in their image processing resulting in a sometimes less saturated and cool image than their competition, especially in a more vivid picture mode. You do still get reflections though, being able to see light fixtures and stuff . But you can't get rid of that without a matte display.  And that would suck for the contrast. Some of the competition is brighter or has better anti glare. But Sony is pretty good in both departments and is awesome in its own regard.

Leaders; I was watching ‚Äúdeath of a game: halo infinite‚Äù by nerdslayer studios and he was talking about the leadership with Microsoft and 343 during the development time for the game and honestly it really applies to the Best Buy I work at and seemingly at other stores that I‚Äôve seen across this subreddit. The leaders at Best Buy don‚Äôt really lead. They see the title and just bark orders or come over to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù. Most don‚Äôt deescalate issues with customers and they don‚Äôt know how or they seemingly don‚Äôt escalate order issues. They never tell new hires or advisors information about the store or company until it‚Äôs last minute and by then it‚Äôs too late. They will also tell new hires the wrong information. Our new Assistant GM told a new hire we don‚Äôt use SKUs for our Apple products when product flow and all advisers on the floor do use SKUs when looking for Apple products. This is my first corporate sales job and it seems like it‚Äôs a complete mess and it‚Äôs a free for all with the leaders on how they should order people around and belittle their advisers when they get the chance. The customers where I work aren‚Äôt too bad but I see what everyone on this subreddit means in that Best Buy is a sinking ship. It‚Äôs a total mess and the higher ups definitely don‚Äôt care about the advisers who do all the selling.

"In the old days the ARA job was a good way to be able to mostly hide from customers and the job description reflected as such (not in so plain terms). But as the company has evolved into a more lean operating model, (that doesn't match customer demand), stores have had to be creative in trying to bring the best experience to the customer.  The new job descriptions for most store positions have been updated to reflect this new mindset. For example here are a few excerpts from the current  Job Description:  The Geek Squad Advanced Repair Agent identifies and offers technology related, solution-based recommendations to solve customer needs and ensure that no customer is left unserved.   They create and maintain a supportive environment for customers by asking the right questions, listening carefully, taking detailed notes and partnering with other team members.   They are passionate about technology and leverage their technical abilities to create positive customer interactions by solving a variety of software and hardware issues.  At Best Buy, we are obsessed with building long term relationships with our customers. Every team member should feel empowered to deliver a world-class and unique experience based on what each customer needs.  Key Responsibilities - Helps drive a positive customer experience by building relationships, exhibiting empathy, and providing solutions for their needs.  I mean it should not be any surprise by now that stores are doing whatever is necessary to try to meet the customer expectations.   Do I agree?  Of course not!  I think the forecasters and labor teams have severely miscalculated the post-covid retail landscape, and lost sight of what made Best Buy great. That formula was simple, train great employees, promot a genuine customer experience and REAL having fun while being the best. That best buy is still there, just being suffocated.  Take my word with a grain of salt, because I've been out of the store since April, but until then I had high enough visibility to see all of this coming and most of my predictions have come to pass up until then. I have faith in all of the store teams and store leaders alike, if the company tanks it is not the fault of teams and leaders on the ground.",jwgz6qm,comment,2023-08-16T12:09:10,t3_15sx2rf,t3_15sx2rf,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/15sx2rf/can_i_be_forced_to_work_on_the_sales_floor_even/jwgz6qm/,BestBuyWorkers

"No it‚Äôs not technically within your job description. If you feel you‚Äôre being treated outside of policy, it might be good to file an HR claim.  Seeing as how the company in general has adopted the mindset of ‚Äúdo more with less,‚Äù they‚Äôre not likely to heed your request though üòï Especially since the most recent snap, all team members have been asked to ‚Äúflex‚Äù to multiple departments for help. That includes recently snapped managers that are now sales team, but still have to act as managers.  As an ARA myself with limited staff and a constant high demand (recently had over 30 items in repair), I push back against management as much as I can. It doesn‚Äôt always work, but standing up for your clients is good ethics. Please pick your battles carefully though‚Ä¶ A few strategies are:  - Offer to help briefly to answer questions or assist with a sale. Outright resistance is subordination, and will not be taken well. Work with them and they should work with you (though I know many managers are unreasonable‚Ä¶).   - Politely decline to be posted at an answer center. If no sales person is available, clients can work with a leader (who should be leading by example btw), or wait in queue like we do during the holidays.   - Remind them that NPS may tank due to extended repair times.   - Clients we have promised to work for take precedent over new clients. While we can‚Äôt outright refuse to help someone without just reason, we should not be taking on more than we can handle, nor should we jump the queue. We work on an appointment based first-come first-serve basis, and take walk-ins as time permits.",jwgtbtv,comment,2023-08-16T11:34:31,t3_15sx2rf,t3_15sx2rf,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/15sx2rf/can_i_be_forced_to_work_on_the_sales_floor_even/jwgtbtv/,BestBuyWorkers

As a SEM I have told my SES to not have agents on the floor. Unless they want to. We focus on NPS and generating labor. Some of the agents do go to the floor but not to sell.

"I was a CA for about 3-4 months before being an ARA but at my store we constantly had lines at geek squad/were constantly booked up by a couple days (the worst was 8/9 days) so the only ""selling"" I ever did was memberships (was lowkey kinda good at it before I became ARA too) but I never went on the sales floor unless it was to sell SSDs/RAM for clients.  So while being asked now to cover for ex: computers, yea I could totally get by by talking about specs, tho I have no idea what sales are currently running half the time (unless it's for parts then I gotchu) only have a half guessed memorization on how the brands are set up on the floor, have no idea where accessories are half the time either and then client tend to ask questions about other departments then im totally lost üòÖ  I won't lie tho, I've only been on the floor a hand full of times, and they've just been the not most ideal scenarios like: multiple people trying to ask questions at once, asking questions outside the computer department, asking the specific location of accessories I have no idea where they are (I do use the app to search), and then asking for general sales that Idk  So while I probably am seeing it as way more intimidating than it really is due to lack of experience, I also really really like focusing on my computer repairs in the back and reaaally don't wanna interact with customers, I have a personal bias against not really wanting to do sales üòÖ",jwhsck3,comment,2023-08-16T15:03:44,t3_15sx2rf,t1_jwhf0sl,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/15sx2rf/can_i_be_forced_to_work_on_the_sales_floor_even/jwhsck3/,BestBuyWorkers

"Snapped in June. Where I‚Äôm at now.; Hey all.  I was with BBY for 5 years.  Started as a sup, did some temp salary work, and finished as a GSM - snapped in June.  I wanted to provide a little perspective and share where I am today in hopes of helping those in similar circumstances or for the rest of you that have had enough.   First, I‚Äôd like to point out that I saw the snap coming, and was not surprised when I got the axe.  I saw the direction that the company was taking: less leadership, low/no specialization of line levels, and more top-level influence on site.  With this in mind, severance was my desired outcome, and it was nice to get handed a check to not come back again.   I‚Äôm not rich, but am in a good position financially, so I committed to two things in my job search:  1) I set up a system/rhythm that I confirmed to daily.  2) No applications for positions that paid less than what I was making when I exited BBY.  3) No applications for something I wasn‚Äôt interested in, regardless of pay.  4) Try like hell to avoid retail. 5) Apply to jobs not in my wheelhouse - look for a new path and emphasize transferable skills.  6) Take my time and enjoy the extended vacation.   I‚Äôve had a number of interviews since then, and what seems like 10x that number in rejections, but I wasn‚Äôt deterred and stuck to my system.  I‚Äôm starting a position next week that pays 15% more than my (capped) GSM pay.  In addition to a comparable benefit package, they also provide biannual reviews, guaranteed equity, and doesn‚Äôt require a flexible schedule. They told me they‚Äôd send me a laptop - assumed I‚Äôd be getting a Chromebook from the pre-COVID era, but instead I got an M2 MacBook Air.  have a slightly larger team, but there are no customers, which is a benefit in and of itself.  Before I started looking, I didn‚Äôt know this position existed, and while it‚Äôs in the tech field, it‚Äôs unlike anything I‚Äôve done before.   The point is that if you‚Äôve been laid off and you‚Äôre still looking, or if you‚Äôre looking for greener pastures, make sure you widen your approach. I don‚Äôt agree with the direction that BBY is headed,",15undf7,submission,2023-08-18T11:17:52,,,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/15undf7/snapped_in_june_where_im_at_now/,BestBuyWorkers
"The point is that if you‚Äôve been laid off and you‚Äôre still looking, or if you‚Äôre looking for greener pastures, make sure you widen your approach. I don‚Äôt agree with the direction that BBY is headed, but as far as retail is concerned, it‚Äôs still an above average place to work.  You‚Äôre not going to escape shitty customers or new initiatives or flavor of the month KPIs just because you switch polos.  If you hate working at BBY, you probably don‚Äôt like retail. It takes courage to break away from the safety net that the retail industry provides - there‚Äôs almost no barrier to entry to land a spot, jobs are always available, and the promise of ‚Äúopportunity‚Äù is always there.  In reality, and with some exceptions, the real opportunity is outside of retail.  Get creative, and leverage your skillset to land at a place that understands your potential.

"Funny stories (current and ex-employees) about of Best Buy miss?; I worked at BB as a Computer Sales Associate for 9 years in the 2010s and left at the end of 2020.  I remember how shitty the company was before Hubert Joly and thoroughly enjoyed all of the things Hubert did to improve all of the stores, including but not limited to cutting executive staff before loval leadership.  Stores back then had a family/friend atmosphere. Our store was the Wild West. We hooked up an iPod to the store‚Äôs speakers and would play music throughout the day and whoever got a Best Buy card, that associate could change the music station. (Pro tip: turning on Christmas music in July caused employees and customers to riot and complain to me to change it hahah)  Two employees got into a ball tag war where they‚Äôd randomly try and hit each other in the nuts while working. It spread like wildfire throughout the store.   An employee poached someone else‚Äôs sale that they had been working on for almost two hours that was $2k+. The employee who lost the sale walked by the poaching employee with a Game of Thrones box set and swung the box set up into the employee‚Äôs ball sack and caused the employee to drop to the ground. The employee took over and got his original sale back while the customer was dying of laughter.  It all ended when an employee was hit in the balls with a pair of airpods while carrying a 30 lb printer down the ladder and fell off and broke the printer haha. HR came in and inquired with everyone and everyone protected each other and didnt say anything, but the GM, who was a G, admitted it happened and laid on the grenade for all of us and got probation. We took him out and bought him some beers afterwards.  When the Force Awakens came out, there was a huge snow storm that effectively kept us from going  home so we all walked to the local movie theater where they gave us a special, free showing of Star WRs until the roads were plowed and salted.  We hooked up our phones to the bluetooth speaker demo products and would wait for the manager to walk through the department and contact customers in that section and then turn on a fart app and have the speaker loudly fart next to the manager haha. Manager was so embarassed and loudly chewed all of us out on the walkies.",15vfuy5,submission,2023-08-19T09:08:07,,,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/15vfuy5/funny_stories_current_and_exemployees_about_of/,BestBuyWorkers

She literally broke down in frustration telling me her Samsung VPL put his 2 weeks in, her LG VPL is transferring to a different store and the person who got moved into a Core Sales position but was previously Home Theater so of course they would cover there a lot put their 2 weeks in. To be clear her frustration wasn't all the people leaving, its the lack of understanding about why the people are leaving. Money, working conditions, lack of appreciation. I told her I will be here anytime to talk but that has to suck to have all that kind of put on you, new people coming in, training them and getting them on par for the incoming holiday season.

"Frustrated and Stuck; I work at corporate remotely. I love the benefits. I love the flexibility. And honestly, my job itself isn‚Äôt bad at all. A few on the team like to micromanage but I mostly overlook it.   My complaint is, I‚Äôm tired of not being promoted. I have a B.S. degree. I‚Äôm a semester away from a M.S. degree. I have years of experience. I use to be a team lead at a different company. Every time I apply for something on iJOS, I‚Äôm denied. I‚Äôm talking about over twenty times in the last 6 months. I reach out to a recruiter for feedback each time. Some don‚Äôt respond but those who do just say others have been with the company longer or their background closer aligns to the role. The latter I can understand. But I haven‚Äôt been here long enough? I‚Äôve been here almost a year and a half.   I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôm better than anyone but I have years of experience in a field, a degree (almost two degrees), and a positive reputation at the company. Rarely late, I never call out, no write ups. It‚Äôs just disheartening to get denied so many times. Part of me wants to just say the hell with it and look for another company. I know logically that quitting just because you don‚Äôt get promoted isn‚Äôt the ideal thing but damn. The pay isn‚Äôt the worst, but I could easily go to Walmart and get a coach position for almost double what I‚Äôm making. It‚Äôs just not worth the headache because a.) it‚Äôs Walmart and b.) no longer remote lol.   Any advice? Suggestions? Am I being too sensitive and not waiting my turn?

Utilize your leaders' connections with other business partners to set up shadowing. 4. Find a mentor in another department.   If you want to discuss this more, OP, feel free to message me.

"Never used Reddit outside of finding the TLC log in; My name is T, jokingly called T-Rex at work which makes my day. I have been with my current Best Buy store since 2013. I have been through so many changes from departments to staff to memberships. Retail has always been described as a stepping stone job but the thing I loved about it was the customer experience. Helping people find what they need, not just what they think they want, solving the never ending problems in the electronics world and building bonds with customers. I have customers still to this day I've been helping since 2013. I've seen their kids grow up and seen some of them go off to college. I've learned a lot, grown a lot and tried to help those around me grow as well. I have gone through a lot with the company like cut backs, mass hiring, many holidays. I had an ASM Ramon who I could easily say was such a supportive and amazing person to guide paths for so many. 2018 I went through something that took a lot out of me mentally (my mom got really sick) and by 2019 she had left this world. Some of my Best Buy experience during this time was supportive. Being a person who had to take caregivers leave when it first released was a learning experience, asking for LOA when she went to hospice was disparaging when it was declined cause I didn't have the right paperwork, only to lose my mom before they approved it. Telling my GM I needed more time than the bereavement time allotted because I was going through a large amount of depression and anxiety and having him support me taking time. Making so many friends and watching them leave for school or other jobs. I was there for 24/7, Total Tech Support, Total Tech to even the new plan. Rallying behind decisions that obviously I have no control over but hoping to inform customers the best way I can. The moral has been so down lately and it takes a toll on the brain. Constant red floors due to lack of staff, people leaving, the grind for memberships (which I don't mind but I do feel like since I deal with so many repeat customers what more can I do if they have already gotten the credit card from me or the TTS to TT and conversions). I love helping customers and getting to learn about their lives. I just feel run down. Everyone is mad about the changes and most will just tell me if you aren't happy",15ysn49,submission,2023-08-23T00:02:46,,,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/15ysn49/never_used_reddit_outside_of_finding_the_tlc_log/,BestBuyWorkers

Am I stressed, yes, did my department move on, yes, do I worry about the new people coming in, yes. Do I understand everyone's frustrations, yes, do I agree with a lot of them, yes, can I change it, no. All I can do is go day by day.

"> asking for LOA when she went to hospice was disparaging when it was declined cause I didn't have the right paperwork, only to lose my mom before they approved it.  Good God, this is absolutely heartbreaking. Like seriously, just grant the LOA and figure it out, clearly you had a lot going on...  As for the rest, I feel it. I got yelled at today (and called every name in the book to the host) because I wouldn't interrupt my customer (who I was checking out) to answer a ""simple question"" because I was the only person in the department today.

"Going to see if they want to hire me to train their employees to better understand bestbuys systems. Getting tired of not doing something about it and the seemingly higher higher ups ups seemingly perfectly fine to let things stand.   Also, looking to see if any accountability can be had. Essentially if a cx comes in with erroneous information from 3pl, through recent interactions/breeze you can see the case the rep made. If it's an actual bestbuy employee that made the case, it's easy to see the organization structure of that employee, so you can get their bosses information if something needs to be addressed, or you can message the employee directly through teams to coach out something real quick. This accountability doesn't exist for 3PL call centers.   When I did work digital sales, there was a chicken guy that existed when transferring to another department (at the time I always transferred with the customer)  In that instance, I passed off the cx by having another rep reach out to them and I stayed on the line with the chicken guy. Nothing but roosters clucking. There wasn't an actual person on the line, just chickens.   I stayed on that line for 4 hours, refusing to believe that digital sales leadership has zero ability to get chicken guy fired. Also stayed on the line cause if chicken guy was with me, then there wasn't any chance of another transfer. Also, it made their numbers look horrible so I hoped with the stone walling of leadership, at least maybe someone in the 3pl call center leadership would see the long call, listen in, and then hold chicken guy accountable.   Didn't work though, swear chicken guy is still going strong as I have heard a cx or two cone in and say all they got were chickens on the line when needing help.  Anyways, at the time, I spent a good amount of my shift trying to find some more detailed information about our 3pl call centers to maybe, hopefully get a good contact number. Digital sales leadership at the time refused to give any info, didn't care, or just remained willfully ignorant of the issue.   I did find some documents with names. I think there were 3 names I found for different regions.  Today, when I generally googled, I came across Sitel (which is now called foundever) that I think bestbuy uses. SITEL sounds familiar.

"Couple of points of view here..  Yes, there is absolutely accountability for 3pl teams. In fact, they have an enormous turn over rate which is actually a problem.   That leads my to my other point. If you want to really help, joining a 3pl company isn't the answer in my opinion. Even if you did and even if it was a training or QA role, you still may make a relatively small but positive move. If you really want to change that world, you need to move up through BBCC leadership. Usually a Sr. Analyst owns the relationship of a 3pl team, so that may be a good place to look into.  Next steps up (Associate Manager, Manager, Sr. Manager) you would have conversations with the 3pl Sr. Leadership, work with and own contracts, negotiate new teams etc.. then I'd say you can make a substantial impact.   As for chicken guy, if you get that information to the right team with the time you called and the number you called from, the leaders can absolutely pull the call. That said, 1 occurrence doesn't typically end in terminating that employee. Just like you or any W2 employee, it would usually be a verbal warning at first but if it's that agregious it may not be the first warning.",jy1no4w,comment,2023-08-27T23:25:55,t3_162jj9o,t1_jxzg7mq,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/162jj9o/name_of_companys_running_3rd_party_call_centers/jy1no4w/,BestBuyWorkers

"Thank you for the response. But chicken guy is popular. I swear I recognized the chickens.   But, in browsing, around, I found a wonderful excell file with lots of names and contacts of 3pl and a good amount of their structure. At least from the view from bestbuy. It's an old by about a year and a half, but yea.   I believe you in that you get the right email to the right person, you can get accountability.  The problem is the availability and knowledge to execute that path towards correcting 3P.  The lack of readily available info, seems very purposeful (which it likely is)  With how easy it is to find store information, then leadership information, etc of bestbuy grown employees, it really should be equally accessible for getting information and coaching to 3pl to fix issues.   Also,I'm looking for numbers. Bestbuy employee customer care is dwindling in favor of 3PL. I'm very curious what metrics leadership is using to justify this move.   If I had to guess. They are looking at heavily at call length and transfer and not much else. That's the only way 3pl can beat home grown CC. I know while I was in that world, when I got someone who had been ran through the call center transfer rodeo, I took as much time as needed to get the customer taken care of. Productivity on paper would be sacrificed, but a customer was taken care of.   If that gap in awareness or recognition that Home based BBCC are more likely to resolve the customers issues which usually means longer times on the phone with the customer, then that's a problem. And, imo, that's what the trend leads me to believe is happening. Some pencil pusher is just seeing black and white data and making calls off of that, or they have a leader who's even more disconnected from the actual problem making quick judgment calls.   I'm seeing that level of leadership through ignorance from market level to store level, so it isn't much of a stretch to believe that's also what is driving decisions concerning home based CC reps and 3pl ones.",jy1qloi,comment,2023-08-27T23:52:59,t3_162jj9o,t1_jy1no4w,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/162jj9o/name_of_companys_running_3rd_party_call_centers/jy1qloi/,BestBuyWorkers

Another point.. if you're in the mid band, new hires are typically brought on at the low band. I say this because I have been in your position and when my pay grade was adjusted I was moved to the very bottom of the new grade. Anyone hired was almost assuredly making more than me even though I had years of experience in the role. In those cases, you can have a conversation with you manager on what you're worth.

"Just got accepted for a part-time position at Best Buy and I have a question in regard to leave of absence (Ontario); So the title pretty much says it all, I've just got accepted at my local Best Buy as a merchandiser/customer support position part-time of course. Although I am excited to start the first career of my life, something is worrying me...  In Ontario, we have a 90-day probationary period for anyone who starts a new job where they evaluate you to see if you are suitable for staying with the company long term. Now, normally I would not worry about this but due to unforeseen circumstances, I am put in a tight situation. You see, come November I have to leave the country to attend to some family matters overseas. This is something that I wasn't expecting and my family told me that I would be staying there for at least 3 months and now that I've just started working at the company I am not sure what to do. In fact, I start my first day on Sunday and I don't know how to approach my supervisor about this.  There are many questions going through my mind about this because I am really looking forward to starting work as I said earlier and I'm worried that I will be let go because of this inconvenience. I understand there are outside factors that are outside of my control but I really don't want this to spell doom to my newly appointed career at Best Buy because this is something that I've really been looking forward to as this is my first job. Do you think that I will be terminated or let go because of this? Will my supervisor be understanding of the situation that I am in?

All employees deserve NEI and designated time training both on and off the sales floor.   3. Mandatory cost of living increases, regardless of pay cap for your job grade.   4. Better health insurance options.   5. No more comp plan changes for commission based sales people without employee agreement and recommendations.   6. No more labor cuts. FT 40 hours. PT 20-25 hours. To go along with this, no more scheduling against availability or overriding availability/normal days off. Regular scheduling options available to those who need it. Any shift picked up after schedule releases gets bonus pay.  7. Minimum start pay $17. Those not are $17 get raised to $17 + a % based on tenure/experience.   8.

"Few more ideas:  * A four-day workweek (either four 10-hour shifts or eventually four 8-hour shifts (but at the same weekly pay as a normal 40-hour workweek)) would be nice too. Would improve work-life balance significantly by always having 3-day weekends (or give flexibility for split days off but still having at least 2 in a row. * Better protections against layoffs/restructures. Don't get me wrong, the severance is nice, but we laid people off that we need now. It feels like the company is restructuring just to make the books look better for a fiscal-year result and not actually for any long-term goal. And if it is a long-term goal, use attrition to reduce the workforce instead of layoffs. * Better medical insurance options. I've never paid as many doctor bills as I have since I started with Best Buy. * And this seems like something we wouldn't fight for, but better training: bring back sales induction meetings with in-person training.

Best Buy has a horrific theft problem, especially with organized retail crime. See it all the time in alerts, there‚Äôs about 12 major groups across the country that target this retailer in particular due to how lax our security is. Either they steal displays, use shuck keys to unlock expensive items, or they break cages open, amongst other methods.   I can‚Äôt share what the company-wide shrink number was but store-level losses far outweigh what it would take to staff the role and treat it the way every other big box retailer treats security.

Waste your time at Best Buy; I've been here full time for almost a year. I've been told by a supervisor and the GSM that I would be a good supervisor. I make $16 an hour which pains me to think about. If I could get to $22 an hour I would be happy as I have greatly reduced my cost of living. I'm saving up for a house but at this rate it's going to take me years just to build up a 20% down payment. I'm trying everyday to be a good employee but what is the point when corporate keeps killing off all the good positions? I'm not in college. I'm trying to move up in the company to make an actual living. But as the months have passed I've seen two shift lead positions and two supervisor positions get eliminated. So what the fuck is the point of spending my time here? I not only have to compete for a better position against everyone else but I also have to wait for one of my two remaining supervisors to leave the company. And if someone else gets that single open position I then have to wait another untold amount of time for someone else to leave. I'm ashamed of myself and I'm ashamed that I work here. It's embarrassing and honestly has been making me depressed.

You gotta find a retail store with a culture that doesn‚Äôt rotate their managers every 6 months to a year. Lots of sales driven stores are like this. If you‚Äôre looking for stability in retail sales you‚Äôre not going to get it. You‚Äôre better off working your way up in a grocery store or somewhere not as sales driven. Managers get shifted around and after 3-5 years the execs will make you want to quit unless you‚Äôre able to meet their unrealistic goals somehow.,k0doqov,comment,2023-09-13T04:42:25,t3_16ha775,t3_16ha775,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/16ha775/waste_your_time_at_best_buy/k0doqov/,BestBuyWorkers

It does take a long time. But houses are much cheaper where I live luckily. Also I intend on putting down enough to be able to pay an additional principle payment each month. I will do this for the sole purpose of avoiding the amortization rate as much as possible. This will require a significant down payment upfront  to get my monthly payment lower.

I'm now trying to find something stable to get me through my last semester of college and have been applying to different positions at both retail and warehouse locations for parttime and seasonal and I get rejected each time after interviews that seemingly go great.

Most of the OG voters have been termd or quit for jobs to actually support there family...... another 4th of the crew were highschool kids that didnt know anything about what was going on and how jobs are......   makeing a service job unionize is tough.

Traffic where I live normally takes me about 15-20 mins to get home. I clock out and head on my way. I get to the bridge that I have to cross in order to get from one city to another, and my tire completely gives out on me. Instead of taking my exit, I take the closer exit and there‚Äôs an auto zone right off the exit. I ask to borrow the store jack, every auto zone has one, and the manager says no. One of the store attendants comes outside to help me jack my car up with a scissor jack, the shitty one my car came with, and my car ends up falling onto the rotor in which the tire was missing. I was infuriated. The store attendant tells me to buy the jack from inside and return it and if the manager says anything about it, to contact corporate. I do just that. Buy the jack, change my tire, return the jack. Manager tells me she can‚Äôt return it because the store doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúrent‚Äù out jacks. I say ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt rent it. I bought it. I was unsatisfied. Now I want to return it.‚Äù The guy who helped me, bless his heart, faked a phone call and was pretending to talk to a customer saying ‚Äúyes, we can return parts. The money will be sent back to your card within 2-3 days. Yes, even opened parts.‚Äù Stuff like that. So she rips the receipt out of my hand, processed the return. I was standing there in my Best Buy blue shirt, and she says ‚ÄúI know I won‚Äôt be shopping at Best Buy anytime soon.‚Äù I say, ‚ÄúWe will not miss your business.‚Äù The next day, I got the guy that helped me out, the store attendant, a $50 gift card to a local steakhouse. And with the remaining $50 I saved by returning the jack, the jack was $100 at auto zone, I bought the same jack off of FB Marketplace for $50. Just a very shitty customer experience overall from management, but a W auto zone attendant. I got home 5 mins before my draft was scheduled and drafted the #3 team out of 16.

"My store religiously sticks to the queue system. I'm front end, taking care of a long line at customer service. As soon as my latest customer walks off, a lady speeds in and cuts in front of the people ahead.  ""I need help, please get someone to help me."" I explain the queue and tell her that the host will put her in for assistance, it won't be long. She disappears, I go back to processing returns.  Some time later, screaming comes from the appliance desk. It's the same woman, shouting about how ""you all have terrible customer service"" and ""I've never been treated this way, never had to wait this long"". I remember it so clearly because there was *venom* in the way she said ""never"", just complete anger and disgust at this crime. I turn to ask for her name, and look in the queue.

And I straight up told him prices of open boxes are non-negotiable. It‚Äôs in our policy. And that I would not be getting my manager since they will tell them the same thing and it would be a waste of both his (the customer) and the managers time for the information to be repeated.

She wanted me to call that store, have them keep their doors open, just so she could get the item. I told her I was not doing that and reminded her of our hours.

"I kinda do a bit of everything from sales/front end and inventory and recently on a front end shift I had a bit of a breaking point. The gist of it is sundays are the absolute worst day to be front end the entire first 1-2 hours of the doors being open are straight up returns and customer service complaint after compliant. Anyway, my front end partner and I get through the initial COD zombie wave of returners that for some reason camp the doors every god damn Sunday and a middle age woman come up to me to buy some shitty headphones.

Tag obviously a completely different item and yep sure enough there‚Äôs 4 of the EXACT same boxes of headphones right next to the 19.99 tag on a rack that says 24.99. I explain the whole process again and show her the  UPC‚Äôs match the 24.99 tag and she thinks I‚Äôm trying to scam her. Walks up to the host stand demands to have me fired and storms out.

I asked for some accomodations, asked if they could take me off truck or at least not make me carry microwaves and heavy desktops up the ladders anymore, etc, but I've been hearing some grumbling from the managers that makes me think they're getting ready to just fire me.",16s15xr,submission,2023-09-25T15:19:11,,,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/16s15xr/can_you_be_fired_for_being_injured/,BestBuyWorkers
"No, they can not fire you for being injured due to work being the cause of the issue.  Contact HR before you talk to the managers and report your physical limitations and problems due to the working conditions.  I'm a warehouse employee myself so I can 100% relate to this. I do everything that is expected of a product flow employee and then some more. Shuttle and Planos are the most physically demanding jobs and you get no support with it either. 400lb fridge, 100 piece shuttle, multiple 85"" TV's etc etc. You name it, I've done it. My body is not the same as it was, yet BBY doesn't care. My peers and managers don't care. The CEO and share holders don't care. If we get broken nobody cares. All that matters to them is ""were you following sop"" for unloading/handling oversized items.  The physical toll it takes on us is unreal. Even with using the right Dolly's and the right lifts it's still an extreme task, multiple times a week to do these things on your own. It's always meant to be a ""team lift"" where needed, yet we fired and cut so many people and scheduled people the bare minimum that team lifting anything is impossible when you're alone or the other people in the warehouse are injured... essentially making you do it alone.  The sales floor doesn't help, they hide behind their registers in groups of 2 to 4 at a time with leaders laughing and joking while you break your back daily and they don't even have the decency or respect to offer help. They're happy to accommodate their lunches and work needs to get bonuses....but any type of team work where they might break a sweat or get dirt on their hands...think again. SOP only exists to get people in trouble, not for the greater good of the whole team.",k26grur,comment,2023-09-25T15:26:59,t3_16s15xr,t3_16s15xr,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/16s15xr/can_you_be_fired_for_being_injured/k26grur/,BestBuyWorkers
"Stock; Does anyone watch the bby stock price? I never had much of my paycheck going to purchase bby stock, but I had a little. A few years ago I decided to sell it and stop contributing, as there are more reliable stocks out there. Anyhow, when I cashed out I believe I sold it for $90 or $91. Since then it has stayed mostly in the 70‚Äôs. Right now it‚Äôs $69.79. The highest I can remember seeing it for over the past year has been mid 80‚Äôs. The main reason I‚Äôve followed it is because my local news station has a scroll, during the morning news, that shows different stocks, bby being one of them. I haven‚Äôt paid attention to the correlation between the higher prices and the ousting of employees, but I‚Äôd bet some research would probably show that trend.

"Memberships and BPs; Just your daily reminder that every time you get someone to apply for the credit card, Citi pays the company between $750-$1000 depending on the time of year. For doing nothing. Other than applying people. And you as the employee see none of this money. Instead, the salaried management make quarterly and yearly bonuses based on your performance. Or even paid memberships. Little known fact, it something is on sale, say from 1k down to 800, most of the time the manufacture still pays best buy the difference so long as no price overrides take place. So even if a product is on sale for ‚Äúmembers‚Äù, best buy still pockets the full gross revenue, as well as the money from the membership. They can absolutely afford to make it worth our wild by offering even $5 per bp or membership, but they wont. They dont see the net benefit in it for them. They only see that instead of making $750 off a bp, they only make $745.

"I finally had enough and walked out the other week after almost 8 years. I started in sales, moved up to sales leadership and then Autotech Lead. I ran the best HT dept this district had ever seen, pulled it up from mediocre to 9th in the entire company. Took over a 2+ year dark install bay and my 2nd year there, was about to get added headcount as it was add 60 hours every week. Then came Corrie and Covid. Bonuses stripped and bay was shut down moving me to another location. I was turned down for Supervisor spots for the past 5 years that I was more than qualified for and watched them give them to people with less experience and 0 skills. There was a GM while I was Autotech that didn't like how I wasn't there to fuck around or let him have parties in my bay and use it for storage. I let him have it one day when he tried to report me to HR for something he didn't even understand.   I watched this company slowly fall apart and kill off all their good employees who had been there for many years, a lot of skill and knowledge left just so they could save a few bucks while they fly around in private jets and  run the company deeper down the shitter. My new GM of the past 6ish months decided to try to pull some bs on me a few times lately, blaming me for situations he created. I'm pretty sure this was retaliation for some things I said in the Blueprint Survey as his attitude changed completely towards me right after the results came out. My old GM who went out of his way to make sure I didn't move up now runs the micro market and I definitely saw a change in him towards me to the point where he didn't even acknowledge my existance the past several weeks since the survey.   I was pushed out by 2 managers who don't know their heads from their asses. I had enough and walked out after putting up with all this for over 5 years. What really triggered me in the end was being told that I don't  care about the customers when I would always go over the top for every install I did. People loved me and my NPS reflected that. I put so much into that place to keep it running by myself with no help from anyone just to be treated like shit at every turn.",k48auub,comment,2023-10-09T23:49:36,t3_17491o2,t3_17491o2,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/17491o2/i_give_up/k48auub/,BestBuyWorkers

No worries. When you do the I9 depending on the hire date set and some other backend things it can take anywhere form a few hours to a few days. I have seen people for odd reasons take up to 12 days to fully populate in all systems and access. 12 days is not the norm at all but I have seen it so relax. Also your time is sacred and you will be paid for it. Don‚Äôt worry about that.

I am currently only interested in one of the part time positions.  I have worked for other big name retailers and most of them do not accommodate college class schedules.  They all offer things like tuition assistance (I am not concerned if BB offers that or not).  I have witness at similar companies that management will agree on working around your schedule, but then when push comes to shove and they need a worker that day.  They tell you its not their problem and you need to figure it out and they schedule you to work.  I am not saying Best Buy is this way, but the industry sure is.

"I am in the same position as you, only difference is this is my first full week at best buy, I started Sunday, and I re-started school this semester. I believe it's all up to the type of managers you get. I applied for a part time retail sales associate position and on my first day when they asked me again for my availability they messed it up not an hour later. I told them I cannot work on Mondays and Wednesdays, also on Tuesdays before 2pm. Every other day I could work from opening to closing. They ended up scheduling me for Monday afternoon, Tuesday morning, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday.   So they gave me a full time 40 hours, two days when I can't work, and in the product flow position which isn't sales from my understanding; it's warehouse. I had to remind them three times to change it; when they made the mistake, at my lunch, and when I clocked out. They finally changed it when I said I won't be coming in at all.  My revised schedule is Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday this week at 32 hours. It still says product flow, but I'll see how and what it is when I work on Thursday.

"Depends on the management tbh. Some will be chodes about your availability, others will work with you on it. FT gets tuition reimbursement but, they expect 100% open availability despite the company rules on that saying otherwise. The downside to bby is, they will be making you do about 3 or 4 people's jobs with no training and hound you on apps and memberships constantly.

"I'm not going for tuition reimbursement. What I'm enrolling in most likely wouldn't be on their approved list.   I'm mostly concerned with scheduling and making sure it's part-time.

It's offshore. They sent all our positions off shore. Those of us who actually worked for BBY the last few years and weren't offshore didn't do this crap. It is always offshore doing it. They say yes to everything to get the good surveys which drives their metrics. It's why corporate said customers were more satisfied with their performance. Because they said yes to everything and filled out surveys saying good things. Then those of us who had the awesome job of explaining when those customers called back that no we cannot do XYZ even though the person they spoke to last time promised we could....they filled out the new survey giving us crappy scores because of them. It's a vicious cycle. After Christmas all calls will be going offshore so brace yourself.,k554kg5,comment,2023-10-16T13:31:49,t3_1797njv,t3_1797njv,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/1797njv/i_hate_the_call_center_with_a_burning_passion/k554kg5/,BestBuyWorkers

The best way to protect your morality is asking every customer to take the survey to show leadership your customers value the service you provide, it won't keep you from ""coachings"" but could protect the hours they give you. The top 3 are excellent surveys (if the customer is a ass don't ask them to take the survey) Best Buy credit cards (because BB gets a kick back off every card (this can be useful and save you customer money)) and paid memberships (this one can be beneficial to your customer but is a yearly auto renewal for the morality part you need to make sure they are aware it renews every year unless they cancel and if they do BB total all the service plan will end when they leave).

"""Employee Discount is 5% over cost. You also get a discount on services Best Buy sells. If the markup is less than 5%, you pay the retail price. You'll always pay the lowest price available.   **The discount kicks in after 30 days of employment. Between November 20th and December 31st, however, everyone can make purchases despite their respective hire date.**  Discount is for personal use only, and you cannot disclose your employee purchase price since it is confidential information. Eligible users include you, a spouse/domestic partner, and dependents under the age of 23. Eligible family members can come with and pick-out an item for themselves, but you need to buy it. All non-cash payments must be made in your name. They can't use your Employee number & ID to purchase a product on their own.  To check the discount on an item, copy the SKU and navigate to the Personal tab on ETK. Paste the SKU on the Employee Price Check section. You can learn more about the Employee Discount Policy on 'My HR'.""",k5tu217,comment,2023-10-21T09:25:59,t3_17cwpja,t3_17cwpja,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/17cwpja/seasonal_employee_discount/k5tu217/,BestBuyWorkers

Don't let them bother you. I'm in the same boat as you are and the best advice I can give you is to try to find value in the Plus or Total membership for the customer. Of course even if it saves them money and gives them peace of mind they may not take it. It should be a natural part of the conversation and not something you just bring up randomly. It's why getting to know your customer's problem is so important. You match what they need with the benefits of a membership and see if it'll provide value for them. If not it never hurts to ask just in case but ultimately don't sweat it if you don't end up getting the membership. BB business model is awful and it's not your fault the company relies on those memberships to make money. Take what I say with a grain of salt though I rarely ever make my daily quota. They expect me to sell memberships to people looking for usb sticks lol.,k62h2r4,comment,2023-10-23T01:14:18,t3_17ec504,t3_17ec504,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/17ec504/best_way_to_sell_a_bb_protection/k62h2r4/,BestBuyWorkers

"New employee noticing the disfunction; I‚Äôm a new warehouse employee. I have a decent career making decent money, but things are expensive now.   I was looking for a part time job and got one in the warehouse. The hiring manager told me she liked me and feels like I would be a good addition because everyone‚Äôs work ethic is.   First day I go in and do computer trainings and that was it. Was never given any further instruction on where to go or who to talk to for training. Haven‚Äôt even seen my manager since, and basically have had to fend for myself. Asking where to go and how to do things.   Here‚Äôs the thing. I notice so much disfunction in the warehouse. People complain about having to find things or how they can‚Äôt find anything. But every time there isn‚Äôt a spot to put something and I ask what to do with it, they just say ‚Äújust put it anywhere man‚Äù. Like yo‚Ä¶that‚Äôs why we can never find anything.   What‚Äôs most annoying is that I can see why the managers are frustrated, BUT ITS THEIR FAULT! If things are messed up and you have a problem with the work ethic of the people currently working there, why would you let the same people train the new guys?

"It only gets worse. It mostly happened when best buy laid off nearly all their warehouse sups and warehouse managers when they did a shuffle of leaders. Those who remain were forced to convert into other positions and operations has basically died in best buys eyes.... because they killed it intentionally.   Those who remain are typically new hires or senior staff who are trying to hold it together. The leadership we have now are sales leaders....the people who have 0 experience with operations yet think they know everything, yet know nothing. It won't get any better. Give up hope and lower your expectations. Me and a few others are holding it together but are in the same boat. The only saving grace with me and my peers is our work ethic  and the need to have a functioning warehouse because it affects us more than the sales floor. It's rough, but we're holding it together.

"Returns/Membership; How many stores have noticed managers using out of policy returns as a way to sell memberships?  The other day I was completing a functionality check on a TV that was missing accessories.  When I was looking at the func check to see who processed the return, I noticed the item was purchased in September.  When I pulled the original receipt the customer did not have a membership so the return was processed out of policy.  I spoke to a manager to see if they knew anything about it and they informed me that they talked the customer into purchasing a membership in return for processing the return.  He looked dumb founded when I told him the TV that was returned was missing the stand.  I also tried to explain to him that the customer could literally get a refund and then just go home and cancel the membership.  Again I got blank stares.

Yes. Best buy makes little to no money on physical merchandise sold so discounting items actually makes the company lose money.

"When Reddit is training our staff, it's a scary day in retail. Be careful when trying to validate, receive/ship trailers. It's very easy to make a mistake that could be a quick fix....or it could be hundreds of thousands of $ of issues.  If you're not familiar with shuttle work or truck work I'd recommend partnering with your SWAT. If you do make a mistake, they'll typically be the best ones to help you fix it.   As the other user mentioned there's a specific process to doing it. If it's shuttle it's about accuracy, not just speed. Don't cut corners and make sure you read everything carefully on RSS and are not just blindly loading and unloading trucks. Doing shuttle is 2nd nature to me along with truck validation.

"For our store, it‚Äôs pretty straightforward. Driver will back up, you‚Äôll get paper from them. We‚Äôll pop open the trailer door and usually there‚Äôs a tote of straps and an envelope with manifest info and seals. The seal you put on when you‚Äôre done is the just a +1 from the seal you took off (I.e. if seal you take off is 111111, next will be 111112 ). On the tc, I‚Äôll log into rss and go to shipping and receiving. You can find the manifest number from the paperwork in the envelope or search using your DC‚Äôs number and a marking a shipped status. It‚Äôll pull up the manifest on the tc, and there will be a little arrow near the top for a drop down menu. From there, I go into manifest validation scan units as I pull them off. Once everything is unloaded and validated, I‚Äôll usually suspend it and back out. I‚Äôm not sure on other stores policies, but you can receive it there and have the picks come through for units. If you have anything to load, go to shipping and receiving, and under the containers tab hit the plus button. If there‚Äôs geek squad units (they‚Äôll have a white container instead of red, as well as a pink slip usually) you‚Äôll hit unload trailer. You‚Äôll have to scan the BOL number, usually really long and on the paperwork the driver handed to you or from the envelope. Then you‚Äôll scan the white containers to ‚Äúunload‚Äù those units. After that, RSS will ask you if you want to load that trailer. This is for haul aways, service units, etc. you can hit yes and scan the containers to load them. (If you have nothing to unload, just hit the same plus button and just go to the load trailer option, then scan containers of units ready to send off. If there‚Äôs nothing to unload or load, forget this step). If you loaded units, when you complete the loading, some paperwork should print out. 3 copies. You‚Äôll sign your name and date under shipper on all these copies, plus the paperwork the driver handed you. Go out to the driver, giving him his paperwork back.

"In your spare time if you have a chance to do some of the E learning, I have found that it helps me become more familiar with some of the products.

For example, some customers will ask me about CORSAIR and I am not an expert on that whatsoever but I was able to lookup what they needed with the SKU number or brand name and point them in the direction of the isle. When they ask me specific questions about the product I try to resonate with them and if I honestly don‚Äôt know the answer I will look it up or try to pull up the features tab on the app under the product information to see if anything in there will answer their question. It can be a pain because the customer has to wait for me to answer but usually they appreciate the effort and if they get upset I usually just be like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I am not super familiar with this product but I can pair you up with someone who would know more about it if you up to wait until they are available to help you‚Äù so it doesn‚Äôt sound like I‚Äôm completely helpless.",kc0slzo,comment,2023-12-04T18:19:51,t3_18ajcq0,t3_18ajcq0,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/18ajcq0/customers_mad_at_me_when_i_try_to_help_them/kc0slzo/,BestBuyWorkers

She‚Äôs mentioned to us that one week that she got no spliffs because that pay period was all AT&T activations. It‚Äôs obvious she isn‚Äôt supposed to do that so my question is what are the consequences?   Like should I stop signing into coreblue for her?,18fj34y,submission,2023-12-10T20:37:15,,,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/18fj34y/verizon_vpl/,BestBuyWorkers
I'm a Verizon VPL as well and I'm always alone. No other mobile associates in my store and nobody knows how to do activations besides me. I also seem to be always activating AT&T and never get any spiffs üôÉ Maybe you should just do the AT&T activation and call it a day,kcuhb8o,comment,2023-12-10T20:39:51,t3_18fj34y,t3_18fj34y,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/18fj34y/verizon_vpl/kcuhb8o/,BestBuyWorkers

You should be doing the activations yourself and not having her do the work and you getting the money for it. It was never designed to be like that and if corporate catches wind you could both be penalized or loose your jobs for doing it.,kcujtib,comment,2023-12-10T20:57:38,t3_18fj34y,t3_18fj34y,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/18fj34y/verizon_vpl/kcujtib/,BestBuyWorkers
My last 6 months in my 7 years at Best Buy was as Verizon Vpl. Drove me to insanity that it was Two Verizon and one Att vpl running mobile.   Had to have people sign in for att or any mobile sale but Verizon but only spiffed for Verizon. Best Buy owns Lively and they always told us we worked for Best Buy but had to have someone else sign in for lively no spiff.

"To those who left years ago and think a union would be dumb, you haven't kept up with nor experienced in the past few years alone. You have jobs being eliminated at much higher rates and numbers than ever before to be replaced with part time or 3rd party labor. People doing 15 other people's jobs with no pay increase. Many people who don't get lunch breaks or are told to work off the clock due to reduced labor with no overtime lest you be written up/put on a final/fired.   Profits are higher than pre covid and the company is spending less money on training and employees while continuing to find new ways to increase profits while lowering headcounts.   HR is a joke, a call center in India! Employees required to use their personal devices to perform their every day duties.   I think a union would be a good idea right now, especially when it comes to the Geek Squad Agents who get it 10x's worse than any blue shirt in store. Everyone is being screwed over while the high ups line their pockets before the company goes bankrupt.

"You're not wrong, but the problem isn't one of logic. It's one of capitalism.   Corporate only cares to do things that makes the stockholders happy. Using profits strengthen the stock price, makes them happy. Increasing operating costs, by paying employees more than the absolute minimum, makes them unhappy.   They don't care about the people doing the actual work.

Multiple people have said it but here are the facts: we are not the bank. We are not their financial advisor. We are not their mom or dad or significant other. We are advisors at a for profit company. The only job we have is to explain your options and let you choose. How you say it can go a long way. For example all my employees are coached to offer whichever sounds enticing with open ended questions (which one sounds best for you) but if they dont want it THEY have to tell me no. With this thinking in mind if they deny you that's on them not you. Plenty of people in this sub will tell you we know which benefit is good for a specific situation.

"I understand that because I know that *I* can't afford the membership, so I don't like having to sell it to customers; I'm sure a lot of them are in the same boat that I am, or in even worse condition financially. Convincing people to enter into an automatically renewing payment feels wrong to me too, because it's so easy to forget that you've signed up for something like that and then you're suddenly getting charged for something you didn't even know you had. I try to offer it anyway just so the managers don't come after me, but the only times I actually try to *sell* it is when there's some kind of offer, like if you get the first year at a discount or something. Otherwise it just doesn't seem worth the effort of going through a whole spiel to me. If a customer says no I don't want to argue with them.

"Yeah I am a seasonal, And they kept pulling me aside to keep asking for BP‚Äôs & Memberships, I still haven‚Äôt gotten a Membership & I‚Äôve already worked 10shifts on the front end. I honestly stopped asking every person & just only ask a couple, Because I can tell already they‚Äôre not gonna keep me. How do I know? Well first off they treat me differently from the other seasonals getting Bps & Memberships. And 2 they‚Äôre not scheduling me as much as the other Seasonals. So in retaliation, I am not gonna bother helping them get BP‚Äôs & Memberships. I am not ultimately giving up on selling them, Its just i am not gonna bother whenever there is not a manager around. Before I decided to do this, I was asking every customer even if they were buying a drink & they kept telling me ‚ÄúNo not today or thats okay‚Äù. Even though I was just pitching the same as what my supervisors were telling me to do & still nothing. And when I do get BP‚Äôs I never even get celebrated over comms like the rest of my seasonal co-workers do. So I still ask just not as often. But it‚Äôs unfortunate that this is all they care about, I have multiple customers acknowledge how helpful I am to them, And all my managers care about are if I‚Äôm selling these Bp‚Äôs or Memberships to customers who most of them can‚Äôt even afford another credit card or membership.

Just started working for geek squad about 3 weeks ago. The way my manager taught me how to sell total tech was to explain to the customer that any service they want to do with us will cost $150 without the membership so it would only make sense to spend the extra  $30 and get all services covered under the membership for the next year.

"Let Go Today; I was informed today that I was being terminated due to attendance violations. (Being late, not calling out or no call no showing). It‚Äôs been quite the experience over the last 20 months. The people I‚Äôve worked with, especially in product flow are some of the funniest, most hard-working people I‚Äôve ever known, and I was honored and privileged to work alongside them.   With that being said, Best Buy, as a corporation, is completely and utterly fucked. Starting at the top, Cori Berri is one of the worst executives I‚Äôve ever heard of. She constantly takes this company and drives it into the ground. It almost seems intentional at this point. She is a fucking idiot and I wouldn‚Äôt trust her to run a lemonade stand, let alone a huge corporation.   To one of my managers in particular, you are an asshole. Plain and simple. You constantly call people out over the walkie for stupid things, knowing damn well that it could‚Äôve been a 1on1 conversation, or one that didn‚Äôt need to occur in the first place. Instead, you sit on your ass or stand at the AP and belittle people. Idgaf how long you‚Äôve worked there, you‚Äôre a dick and I hope you eat shit. You constantly bring morale down throughout the store and then wonder why people don‚Äôt have good attitudes.  To the managers, STOP INTERRUPTING CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN SALES FLOOR AND CUSTOMERS. It has to be the most deflating thing in the world when you‚Äôre having a good conversation with a customer, selling them product, learning about them and their interests, and then hearing over the walkie, ‚Äúoo (salesperson‚Äôs name), looks like a good membership opportunity‚Äù. I hear that and I can feel the balloon being deflated. Fuck your stupid memberships, fuck your stupid credit cards, 99% of customers don‚Äôt want it and you make the interactions worse by shoving it down their throats.   With that, Best Buy needs to bring back specialization. One of the biggest complaints that customers have is that ‚Äúyour sales floor doesn‚Äôt know shit about the product.‚Äù Well, how could they?

"Real answer if you care is that the pens don't work on common counterfeits. The pens detect if the bill is made of paper or fibers that's it.  Common counterfeits bleach small denoms and print large on the bill, like bleach a $5 and print $100 on it.  Counterfeit pen will show as real. Gotta hold up to the light and check watermark, look for reflective ink on the number, also real bills you can feel ridges on the jacket of the portrait.

"I started a job in May last year, what I didn‚Äôt know was they cut hours after Christmas ( big box building material store) we got 1-2 days a week until spring when planting season was back. Some full time people changed their store position until Spring and then went back to their regular positions. We were working a lot over Summer, I‚Äôm part time doing full time hours. This year they didn‚Äôt hire any seasonal workers for the Summer or Christmas, we actually lost several people but they did not replace anyone. So this year I‚Äôve had a ton of extra work and think it will remain the same after Christmas til Spring with just a few hours cut. We all want a more consistent schedule so I guess this is how they are trying to keep their regular team and still give us consistent hours after the holiday rush. Most places hire seasonal employee to help during the busy times and when the sales start to drop they let them go again, if you‚Äôre really good, want a job and they have an open position they may offer to hire you as a regular employee otherwise they don‚Äôt need that extra help and a lot of seasonal people don‚Äôt need that extra money .",kf8at94,comment,2023-12-27T21:21:36,t3_18sf67d,t3_18sf67d,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/18sf67d/did_i_get_laid_off/kf8at94/,BestBuyWorkers

Back room fulfillment SOP?; Does anyone know where to find the SOP stating pics and packs are considered fulfilled once staged? Or is it just once the pic is completed?

"Can't find it right this second, however pick time starts from the moment it is in the pick list, to the moment it's staged.  This does not apply to any picks prior to opening. However if the opening picks are still in the list AT time of the store opening to the public, they have the full time applied from the moment it populated to the moment it was staged. So a N/A pick becomes a 2 hour pick. In general as long as it's below 60 minutes, you're fine. If any leader tells you it's 30 or less, then they're making it up for the sake of metrics.   Edit: this time of year the whole idea of 1 hour or less is a joke. Realistically it won't happen. Unless your store is in perfect condition and everything is 100 put away or put back where it all belongs, is received right, planoed right and 0 customers moving stuff around....if you get it under 1 hour, sure.

"A lot of the internet attorneys on here need to give up their ‚Äúlicenses‚Äù to practice internet law.   There are plenty of credible resources regarding employment and HIPPA on the internet. Especially where the info is specific to doctor‚Äôs excuses. Go to those resources instead of these faceless, credential lacking, unregulated internet lawyers for your guidance.  I‚Äôll suggest looking at the sites of law firms that specialize in employment law and sick leave rights. When those attorneys say ‚ÄúThe HIPAA privacy rule states that an employer may request a doctor‚Äôs note from an employee, but only if it is necessary for an acceptable reason, like sick leave, Workers‚Äô Compensation, or health insurance.‚Äù, it tells you that responses suggesting  employers can‚Äôt require a doctors excuse are wrong. It could possibly still be contrary to a company‚Äôs internal policy, but that still doesn‚Äôt make it illegal.  In my place of employment, the doctor‚Äôs excuses need only read that ‚ÄúMr. Smith was seen in my office for illness or treatment and can return to work on this date with or without these restrictions‚Äù. If there are no restrictions, you‚Äôre allowed back to work. If there are restrictions, if the job you do can accommodate those restrictions, then you can come back to work. If we cannot accommodate those restrictions,  you can‚Äôt return to work until those restrictions are lifted. Which also means a return to the doctor to provide the statement saying no restrictions. And that only means time off with pay if you have the PTO to burn. If you don‚Äôt, you are off in an unpaid status. And in all of this, we obtain no information that violates HIPPA.  One thing to note is that if you don‚Äôt have the PTO and you aren‚Äôt in a protected status such as FMLA, you can be terminated for excessive absences. The loss of  a minimum wage job in a job rich environment may not be a big deal to a lot of people, but job history and a previous employer saying nothing more than ‚Äúineligible for rehire‚Äù may impact your ability to replace that job or to get a position that is actually a well paying job down the road.  And who came up with or approved  these policies? Attorneys licensed to practice law in our State.

How about we direct the ones who call screaming and cursing us out straight to you so you can handle that for 8 hours straight. Especially when they are screaming about crap that happened IN THE STORE and are taking it out on whomever picks up the phone. Just let us know where to forward these calls to. I'm sure you can handle it so much better.  Or better yet can see through it when the customer claims we  told them something is in stock and shows up for it when we actually told them it isn't/it has go be ordered but they think if they show up and scream loud enough one will magically show up on the shelf/back warehouse. Because I have absolutely seen THAT happen and it was a riot. Just remember if you take a 2 minute breather to collect yourself after the 5th person in a row has told you to unalive yourself because you aren't in the physical store you are going to have adherence messaging you telling you to get back on the phone.,kg2at0t,comment,2024-01-02T20:27:31,t3_18wz6o9,t1_kg17pku,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/18wz6o9/fyi_for_store_employees/kg2at0t/,BestBuyWorkers

Finally you are active status in the system. 5. Then you get put on the schedule and you have to reset your password. You will probably have to call support because they will forget to give you access to something after you return.  What you probably did was  1. Told your boss to put you on the schedule, so they did. 2. You worked one day and they got in trouble because you weren't made active in the system yet. 3.

this is 100% unethical and illegal.

I worked for best buy for 7 years at 5 different stores and on each coast of the country. They're remarkably all the same when it comes to the managers blowing off part timers and keeping staff in the dark. They won't say its normal, but it is.   It happened the same every year.

"Thief incident; So the other day I was working on the floor in the closing hour ( plz keep in mind thieves, or as we call them ‚ÄúVIP‚Äôs‚Äù are very common at our store) especially during closing hour As I was making my last laps around the store making sure we were customer clear I hear a call on the radio saying we have a suspicious customer who has multiple videos games in his hand and is in a blind spot of the camera  They asked that somebody go over there and see whats going on I was by the area so I walked right over  I see the guy stuffing the video games up his shirt and he was facing the wall so I walked around so he did not see me approaching and I crept up being me and just said ‚Äúexcuse me sir?‚Äù He turned around and his heart dropped I asked him to give me what he took and he insisted he didn‚Äôt take anything  After asking him a few time I asked he lift up his shirt cause that‚Äôs where he was putting the games he was hessitant and would only pull his shirt halfway up he also had a waist trainer on for some reasonüíÄ he pulled his shirt up finally to where I could see his stomach but I seen the game case poking out so I told him give it to me  He gave me 3 Nintendo switch games and I also took the other 4 Xbox games he had to the side  It was peaceful for the most part he gave them to me I told him get out of here let‚Äôs go  Now as I‚Äôm walking he was  in front of me about 5 feet I‚Äôm just walking behind him telling people on the radio what‚Äôs goin on And as we‚Äôre walking he tried to reach for his gun but it slipped out of his pants and fell right in front of me  At 1st I thought it was another game but when it landed in front of my foot I knew exactly what that was  I backed up immediately and put my hands up for a split second  He instantly grabs it and says your good your good I just point to the door and tell him to leave He concealed the gun again and proceeded to leave  Looking back on it this was kinda scary considering the gun was pointing right at me in the floor and the outcome could have been very different this happens a few days ago still is something so crazy I never thought he would be armed     I have the video of it but idk if I should post itüò≠",18z296s,submission,2024-01-05T03:43:21,,,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/18z296s/thief_incident/,BestBuyWorkers

"The selling of a Best Buy Plus or Total Membership is really that big of a deal?; I work on a national call center phone line, and for me, it is very worrying that the team of workforce tries to push the Best Buy Plus and Total Memberships as often as they can.

My management team wants me to offer the membership in ALL the calls, even the ones for transactions where the customer is only interested in getting X cheap product (like just a CD Player or some headphones ledser than $ 100).  Even when the customer already told us they don't plan on getting a service! Just the product.

I think what the biggest issue is is that you go from basically giving free services in home to anyone with a membership to now essentially asking them to pay full price for everything instead. The pendulum swung to the complete opposite end of things. Memberships will be easier to talk clients into when they return to some form of discounted payment across all services and they can actually see how much they are benefiting from signing up. Just my 2 cents.,kgr3u8x,comment,2024-01-07T12:09:57,t3_190r6sq,t3_190r6sq,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/190r6sq/the_selling_of_a_best_buy_plus_or_total/kgr3u8x/,BestBuyWorkers

I think with my actual experience, the best moment in which I can get this membership into the conversation it is as soon as possible (so QA can listen into it), just before sending my cart/invoice, and at the end of the call, OR if the customer mentions something related to the benefits like a return and exchange/having a device broke in the past (this is for the total geek support) without me explaining it first.

It's kinda like the razor and blades sales model. If we get the the membership (which theoretically makes little to no money) then we will sell more stuff that does i.e. cables and what not.   Personally I think bestbuy went in to deep.  With how little the staffing is at stores the customer experience is kinda poor. It makes sense that we want to offer it to everyone because even if someone isn't purchasing something today they might still be interested in signing up.  It just seems like bestbuy put all their eggs in that basket,kgq5nvk,comment,2024-01-07T08:13:20,t3_190r6sq,t1_kgq4agt,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/190r6sq/the_selling_of_a_best_buy_plus_or_total/kgq5nvk/,BestBuyWorkers

Unless the agents personally use the software themselves in their personal time.  Most agents wont know how to use every specialized software.  Its like asking the guy who makes paint, to paint a picture.   We can do training for computers, proper use, internet safety tips, general questions about Microsoft Office 365, etc etc.  (General Knowledge)   Now, if agent has a idea what program, or software client wants to use.  Some of us will on our personal time, do self training, before meeting the client.  But also some of our agents do come from different backgrounds and they all walk different paths in life, so they have different specializations.   But in alot of cases, if you setup in home appointment, with expectations  that we going to teach client about specific software they purchased, or for in store training (please make sure you note it).

"Yeah thats not a thing, and won't ever be a thing. Prices change so often that it doesn't make sense to completely modify POS to pull in a custom priced order.   That's why the ""Order Proposal"" button exists. It falls under a different erosion bucket for the store and isn't (or isn't supposed to be) counted negatively against the transacting store.   I personally love the 14 day proposal price lock.

I even brought up how the situation was affecting my work and slightly my mental health and they basically dismissed and disregarded it.

"I think its hard to list all the pros and cons tbh since a lot of them can be shared. What I can say is GS has a bit of a harder time when it comes to interactions. People are coming in specifically because something doesn't work and they can't fix it. Unlike coming in and buying a new TV after 10+ years. For this reason there are more upset client's whether you're telling them their manufacturer warranty doesn't cover their 1000$ laptops broken screen, or telling your turn time is 5+ days (unsure of your precincts turn time just an example), or telling then it can take 1-3 weeks for service center repairs. I've had to tell people their cherished memories of loved ones that have passed away are gone because data recovery wasn't successful/possible. What I can say is GS for the most part was the most exciting and loved position I had at BB. There were some terrible times and experiences but the positive and fun outweighed it. I was a top performer as a sales associate (million dollar writer it was called at the time). I left sales and went into GS and spent 7 years as CA/Sr/ARA/GSM. I loved my time with GS and even in those really shitty moments, there were so much good/fun memories I had. I personally say go for it, no longer with the company but from what I have heard sales is a dead end and far more miserable.

But I do think Curbside is a competitive option that pretty much all retailers need to offer, it doesnt require almost any customer services at all, and there are likely customers who would not shop at BestBuy if it was not an option.   You have several demographics that use it often; Sick, Lazy, Don‚Äôt want to look ‚Äúready‚Äù, ‚Äúits too cold outside‚Äù, or Want it today but don‚Äôt want to go into a store.   I am sure there are many more, but these are people who may not order from Bestbuy if the option wasn‚Äôt there.

"We didn‚Äôt really raise a group of people to be like that, look at the demographic of people who do store pick up, it‚Äôs not mostly people who have been ‚Äúraised‚Äù recently.   It doesn‚Äôt cost jobs to reduce the time customers spend in store, it‚Äôs costs job for them to stop making the in store experience any good.   People didn‚Äôt stop going into bestbuy because curbside became and option, prior to curbside there was store pickup customers, who notoriously didn‚Äôt spend money in store anyways, so they just added to the queue in store and took in store resources at customer service, moving a portion of that to curbside which doesn‚Äôt need someone trained in customer services and returns (CS staff means that the store can borrow from warehouse or other non-customer roles).  The biggest loss of jobs was removing decent training for the Sales rolls, reducing staff in record profit years, and choosing profit over staffing. BestBuy was a much better shopping experience 3+ years ago and I don‚Äôt think they are going anywhere super soon but they aren‚Äôt trying to cater to  instore sales anymore, just think of the displays in your store that haven‚Äôt been updated for years or don‚Äôt work, and how many people you have working at once.  I also think the clientele for bestbuy went downhill with Covid, but don‚Äôt blame the customers for corporate mistakes, and definitely don‚Äôt blame curbside pickup for loses in employees, it secures sales that may not exist otherwise and sales is where the money to pay employees comes from.

"Ehh I can see them upset at us because we have a more efficient precinct than many I've seen. Our function checks are always between 0-5 as we do them the moment they come through. I know when a customer is buying something or not, and many times I'll function check small stuff while they are blabbing their story. Average around 2 totals a day usually on top of that. If a customer is going on too long I let them know we gotta end it there for the 20 min consult. Our ARAs prefer to call clients. Etc. This results in us having SO MUCH free time while still making more labor than we spent (we are positive labor for a while now and even donating our hours). We also do not help code 1's because corporate told our managers we are not to do that. (Our managers were making us do customer service ALWAYS, and so we emailed HR and forwarded our managers asking about it. HR replied and told us that customer service and front lanes are NOT in geek squads job responsibilities. Because of that they refuse to even call us for code 1's. Always remember if you are being taken advantage of, make a paper trail and ask hr if it's allowed. The moment they say no, your store will back off entirely.) So many times we are found doing nothing in the back being lazy and having fun :) but every store member knows they can come to us for anything, we often will buddy up and help our store associates sell a total by them bringing their client to us to ""techy explain"" some technology or benefits. We never turn that down. But if we did all our job responsibilities, I'm sorry we aren't responsible for doing things outside our job description and we wont. Just as it's not blue shirts fault we are understaffed often.

"Left Best Buy After Six Years; Some Tips and Advice for those Employed.; 1. Work hard, but not too hard. If you‚Äôre trying to get promoted within your store then personal performance matters, but it doesn‚Äôt in the eyes of corporate. Being likeable by others is often more important than your numbers when it comes to promotions.  2. Your experience in retail will vastly be determined by the managers at the store. If you don‚Äôt like your management, look for another store in the area and switch over. The extra 10 minute drive is worth not hating your life every single day you clock in.  3. There is no job security in retail. The position you‚Äôre working now will most likely not exist in another year or two. If you can‚Äôt constantly adapt to new roles, stores, and responsibilities, then retail isn‚Äôt for you. (This isn‚Äôt exclusive to BBY)  4. Don‚Äôt be afraid to apply for positions you don‚Äôt feel qualified for. I got a work-from-home corporate position after being in retail for a long time with no degree; again, you need to be likeable by others.  5. Steer clear of post-military employees, specifically those in management roles. They take their jobs way too fucking seriously and you don‚Äôt get paid enough for that bullshit. This isn‚Äôt the Marines, it‚Äôs Best Buy for Christ‚Äôs sake.  6. Stand up for yourself. I see too many people get walked over by others at this job.  7. Don‚Äôt fuck with the installers; be nice to them. Leave notes on your orders. The installers are your best friends if you take care of them, I‚Äôve had many go back to job sites and clean up some of my mistakes on orders. They‚Äôll save you from many angry customers.  8. Don‚Äôt fuck with the Geek Squad employees either. See above point for reference.   9. HR doesn‚Äôt mess around. In 99% of cases it‚Äôs so much easier for them to fire someone. If you actually use the HR hotline as you should, you will see someone lose their job (provided you have a valid case).  10. You may see your position as a career, but corporate does not. The reality is that 99% of retail positions have high turnover rates, and corporate treats them this way.  11. The current sales model is extremely broken and a far cry from what it used to be at Best",199f5h8,submission,2024-01-17T21:29:08,,,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/199f5h8/left_best_buy_after_six_years_some_tips_and/,BestBuyWorkers

I should have stated it differently since I feel like my post came off too harsh in that part.

"Hey I got a similar notice about one of my medications, and I called the insurance to find out what could be done.

If you haven't yet, try calling the insurance to work it out and see if there are other options available.

They 100% control how much it costs. They negotiate premiums and coverage and quite frankly can provide any version of cost from free to nothing based on what level of costs they are willing to absorb.

Well thats great it worked out that way for you! This was already on the 90 day as I changed it that way to the mail in pharmacy through them to save money last year.

The goal is to stay as close to industry minimums so benefits do not become a siding factor in retention while providing the least benefits possible. There is an equation designed around employee options at a middle management position down. Their goal employee is No Family / Male / Under 30 / No Education.

Covid was nothing. I did not even receive a covid shot and never got covid until I went back to work and worked right beside someone Who had this shot and I still got COVID and I recovered from it it was like a bad flu but here's the thing I take care of myself and other people in my home do too.  the people that don't take care of themselves or more likely going to be sicker if not dead because of their ignorance of shoving f****** junk food down their throat all the time and not taking care of they're body stop. trying to gatekeep someone or gaslight someone Over something so over exaggerated. covid did nothing but inform us from us that people are That people are stupid and sheep   People that trust the government and media are SHEEP,kixavxa,comment,2024-01-21T13:54:58,t3_19bjliq,t3_19bjliq,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/19bjliq/our_store_didnt_follow_covid_protocol_at_all/kixavxa/,BestBuyWorkers

This wasn‚Äôt a best buy but a sears where I grew up by had used big trash cans for theirs, this was during hurricane season and Florida being hit with hurricanes and floods. My friends dad worked there and they had to use duck tape and patches to keep the roof from leaking however they had to replace it every few days. The building was one that was near impossible to get someone in to fix it. But now that sears is gone the building was liquidated and something else is probably there now.

"I‚Äôve been with the company for over ten years now. I‚Äôve done just about every role except for management (I don‚Äôt have the right personality lol). There have been ups and downs. I‚Äôve worked with many people; most good, honest, and hard working.   I tried working in an office for two years while being O/S and I hated it. I thought that the nature of the work was a net positive for the world. I learned quickly that the grass isn‚Äôt always greener, it‚Äôs just a matter of how well you maintain it. I came back and switched roles again. Felt like I was home.  I started at the bottom as a part time home business group sales associate. I know the anxiety of only having 12 hours on my schedule. The resentment towards others receiving preferential treatment. The realization that life isn‚Äôt fair and that sometimes you come up short. All these lessons hurt but I still learned a lot about not only myself but how the business works.   Best Buy is a company that‚Äôs being ruined from the top down, but it‚Äôs provided a lot for me and my family. I have two good cars and time off to enjoy working on them. I can see my family and friends regularly. I wouldn‚Äôt have graduated college without this job, nor would I ever be in a place where I felt I could finally become a father.   I don‚Äôt know how much longer this company has. It can be ten years or ten months. But it gave me an education and a hell of a resume. More personally, it gave me friends that have lasted me years and memories that I‚Äôll always cherish.

"Erosion is a very broad spectrum that comes from a lot of different places. Internal and external factors come into play for a lot of it. I won‚Äôt go into specifics on it because I‚Äôm sure you know about theft, inventory issues, bad returns/exchanges etc.. as for the walking business aspect. From my understanding the company prides itself on giving the customer you are with a 10/10 experience while providing a complete solution for them. If you can build that trust and relationship with your customer then you will gaining a potential long term or life long customer who will shop more often and spend more money. Unfortunately that means you walk a lot of other customers due to not having product or long wait times. The company stands by their commitment that they would rather walk many more potential customers if it means the ones that are in front of us are taken care of. Which in retrospect, if we don‚Äôt forcibly change the customers way of thinking and how to shop then it won‚Äôt even matter. The plan is move all that to instore/in home consultant and designers who can give that experience and build a package and everyone else needs to order online for store pickup. The stores will become just show rooms with minimal grab and go product on display. (Think Apple Store or carrier phone store). This will reduce a lot of retail operating costs and make up for all the erosion that you speak of. Best Buy is going to become a cross between a vendor show room with demos and an Amazon fulfillment type center for item pickup.

"Delivery Issue Am I going to get my tv?; So, I bought an open box tv about a week ago and the worker sales guy was super nice and helpful.  So nice that when I got home I decided to send an email to corporate about how nice he was.

I reached top 10 in my territory and you absolutely do not need to lie to get memberships. There's so many easy ways to show people it's absolutely worth every penny. You just have to be aware about what a customer actually cares about. Plus has easily been my favorite because it's essentially the best value IMO. Total is great too! I recommend thinking critically about each individual membership benefit and really understanding just how much value is being left on the table. Most customers will listen to you especially when they are making a heavy purchase of $500+ dollars. Especially if it means they can save ANY money at all.,koz7rxv,comment,2024-02-04T22:42:12,t3_1aj1kcj,t3_1aj1kcj,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/1aj1kcj/lying_to_customers_about_total_tech/koz7rxv/,BestBuyWorkers

"It all depends on the store and the local management, HR doesn‚Äôt really do much to support any of the employees so if your supervisor is a dick you‚Äôre not really gonna get any help.

Everyone in my district has always been really supportive. And I think sometime last year they started offering pronouns on your name tags. The company overall at least puts up a good front of being welcoming to all, and if you get a good store it can be a great environment.

Because in geek squad you are selling them the membership for the benefits to apply to something that they have already invested in.

"Team up with geek squad often for packages and educating client in tech and protection.  It helps a lot, we are your friends!   Ill have someone from sales floor first mention protection and then they'll bring them over to us. Or for apps many times customer wants a high end pc but needs that little push or education on a computer to get that app. We get no metric for apps so we can help with that.  Totals arent as important for us either but they still count, not as much as for sales floor but if we really help then we split the total. If not you can have it fully.   Use us often too! Lets say you're in computers and client is asking about upgrading their current laptop to a new one. Let them know we can set up their device for them! Ask them if their data is important to them because we can also transfer all that data from the old device to the new one. Client is looking for something a bit more powerful or more storage but doesn't want the highest end model? Ok mention them we can upgrade their storage or ram in many models to customize what they want. And whats this? All that is covered under Total. Oh and guess what even more, they can use that credit card they just got on it :).",kr58sso,comment,2024-02-19T10:13:11,t3_1aucdoj,t3_1aucdoj,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/1aucdoj/pms_and_apps/kr58sso/,BestBuyWorkers

For apps, find the objection tbh. If you‚Äôre struggling it‚Äôs pitch, price, or product.

Because fun fact $100 back from opening a credit card is a terrible introduction amount most places give you 50 or 100 (150 for Amazon visa) for literally just opening the card no purchase required imo not worth it for a hard credit check unless they plan on shopping with bestbuy often. Financing is what most people are interested in at least in my area. At a 31.99% interest rate it's a terrible card for people who aren't responsible if I didn't want the financing I would take my hard credit inquiry elsewhere. üòÜ,kr4xf9i,comment,2024-02-19T08:56:29,t3_1aucdoj,t1_kr32aso,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/1aucdoj/pms_and_apps/kr4xf9i/,BestBuyWorkers

"Bay Closures; Has anyone heard any whispers about bays closing? I've been worried since last November about ours. Our busy season last fiscal year had us booked out at least a month in advance while these last few months we've been booked out at MOST 8 or 9 days during our supposed busy season. At one point I was pulling shifts as a CA up at the precinct because labor was so short, now they're pulling labor from the precinct so I can still work my hours doing what I enjoy in my designated position. The problem now is our precinct is running into a labor shortage as well and I feel as if management will probably start cutting us down to 1 CA and 1 ARA at any given time.  Technically our bay is supposed to have a part time and a full time tech, but was changed years before I was moved to autotech and we have 2 full time. My thoughts are by the end of summer they will either drop my position to part time or kill it entirely since it's no longer sustainable because we aren't generating enough labor to pay for it, or close our bay entirely and expand our warehouse. The only thing keeping our bay afloat now is the fact that we're the only open bay for quite a long distance and NOT booked out a month.",1awjt9k,submission,2024-02-21T13:45:04,,,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/1awjt9k/bay_closures/,BestBuyWorkers

"I‚Äôll probably get downvoted for this but this is my honest opinion and experience. I met my current bf when we were both working at Best Buy. I was originally a CA and he was a VPL(AT&T). He would get his ass reamed when he would come into the back of the precinct to ‚Äúask a question‚Äù (aka flirt with me before we started dating) and his ass was rightfully reamed. There‚Äôs not really a reason VPLs should be behind the precinct. HOWEVER I moved positions to become full time and became a VPL (TMO). At this point we were not dating but eventually spending every shift together 8 hrs a day/ 5 days a week became the beginning of our relationship. We set CLEAR BOUNDARIES to continue to do our work without making it weird or obnoxious. Our managers knew and I even suggested getting us put on opposite schedules so we weren‚Äôt being shown any favoritism. You‚Äôre allowed to love who you love but PROFESSIONALISM is key regardless if it‚Äôs just Best Buy. Your EM needs to piss off if he‚Äôs doing it for no reason but I‚Äôve also been in his position and seen couples that can‚Äôt stay away and employees complain.

Hate to break it to you but working with your girlfriend is viewed as a conflict and you'll have to go above and beyond to not mix business with pleasure if you want it to work. I've had multiple relationships at best buy and I got talked to any single time I was hanging with her even if just for a minute. The other employees will cry how they can't hang with their friends but you get to go talk to your girlfriend. I know it sucks and I'm not saying it's fair but life isn't fair and this is corporate America. They will see your relationship as a conflict and they like to eliminate conflicts. There's not really much you can do about this situation because HR is almost definitely going to take the managers side especially in this situation.,krv7ll3,comment,2024-02-23T21:55:14,t3_1ayeafw,t3_1ayeafw,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/1ayeafw/management_issue/krv7ll3/,BestBuyWorkers

"They didn't interact with each other.  He took a sip of a drink.  Did you even read what they wrote?  Sure, maybe they are lying and OP and their girlfriend actually had butt sex up front.        Normally though, you just answer the question based on the facts provided, and maybe throw in a little ""Of course, there are two sides to every story.  This advice only applies if what you said is accurate"", or something similar.  Why does he have to buy his own drink, and why are you so insistent on this point?  Why can't any two employees decide to share a drink, if that is their choice?  If you think OP walking up to the front to get that sip is an issue, would it be alleviated by forcing all employees to keep all drinks in the break room?  I mean, they'll just be walking to a different space.  What if OP's girlfriend happens to be in the break room at the same time?  This story is basically, ""I walked up front for all of a couple of minutes to grab a sip of a drink.""  It doesn't really matter who the drink belonged to, OP had permission to take a sip from it.  If the only problem is him being at front lanes... then that restriction should apply to everyone.  Not just those who have a girlfriend working front lanes.

"Sometimes the ""job you're getting paid to do"", requires that you interact with other employees.  I can't count the number of times me and a CA were talking about a client issue, and some manager comes along and reminds us that there is a customer at the counter.  The one we were discussing.  Then, when that is explained to them, they always find some other bullshit to complain about.  Never mind that every other leader in the building had been singing our praises regarding all of our metrics.  Nah, they just got humbled so they have to make a big deal about the one piece of trash on the counter or whatever other piddly bullshit they can come up with on the fly.  I do the job I'm paid to do.  I do it well.  I am paid well above cap for my position.  I've been with the company for 11 years now.  I'm also 45 years old.  I don't need anyone micromanaging who I speak to.  Maybe they should do *their* job and offer training, advice and guidance, instead of just walking around with a report they didn't even generate and reading it to us.  Anyone in the building, hell the guy who empties our trash and cleans the bathrooms, can read a report and tell everyone how much they suck.  The most complicated thing they have to do is tell a customer no.

"Flex pay & Wage groups are broken for ARAs; Im an ARA and i've been with the company coming up on 7 years, 3 of those with GS. In an effort to meander my way into more responsibility, I became our stores first shift lead back when the program went national and I did it to be able to help out my team, grow my skills, and overcome obstacles that not having access to certain systems presented. Great, except theres one glaring issue: Im an ARA and the shift lead program was clearly never intended to have ARAs become shift lead capable.  For an advisor or CA in wage group 10, the bump to base pay WG40 when scheduled as a lead makes sense, it may not be a big bump depending on how close they are to cap, but generally you still make something going from WG10 to WG40. The issue is that the flex pay program for shift leads automatically puts you at the base rate of WG40, even if you're someone like myself who makes more than that. What does that mean? It means that when I get scheduled as a lead, I actually take a pay cut of $1.22 despite going from WG30 to WG40 because im approaching cap. Because of this, its not been sensible for me to be scheduled as a lead for going on a year now, but because I don't mind the extra work I'm used as a floating lead essentially whenever I work.  You would think I would put my foot down and be angry that I get no additional compensation for the extra work (part of me is), but to be honest most of what I do and have access to just make my job and my precincts job easier so I look over it (IE: Schedule making, overrides, NOVA admin, back office/superuser, procurement/ariba, DBT - but NOT powerBI since you have to be scheduled as a lead once every 7 days for powerBI to populate data).  Being said, even though i've basically accepted the extra responsibility, it still doesn't cover up the fact that the flex pay program and wage group system is broken when it comes to ARAs or anyone outside of WG10 as a whole.",1b5aepu,submission,2024-03-03T01:28:24,,,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/1b5aepu/flex_pay_wage_groups_are_broken_for_aras/,BestBuyWorkers
"Talk to your leaders. An ARA can be scheduled in a different department and keep their pay if the ""activity"" is still Entitlement. The department determines what labor bucket your hours are from and the activity determines pay. The job part doesn't seem to matter.

This has been a thing since they first introduced flex pay. They stopped it for a while because most people flexed down on pay while they revamped it. As an ARA you technically can‚Äôt be a SL because of this issue. Your pay grade is higher than the advisors and would have the issue of flexing down like you‚Äôre experiencing.,kt4n4bl,comment,2024-03-03T04:43:33,t3_1b5aepu,t3_1b5aepu,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/1b5aepu/flex_pay_wage_groups_are_broken_for_aras/kt4n4bl/,BestBuyWorkers
"Thats not entirely true unfortunately. While its true that the labor comes in the form of leadership, BOP, FOP, etc, and the activity can be virtually whatever they would like, the job is what determines your pay, such as sales generalist WG10, Consultation WG10, precinct repair WG30, and the three shift leads (Employee, Process and customer) WG40.   Changing the job from WG30 to WG10 for example, as in an ARA being scheduled to work as a CA, changes your wages for that job from your primary pay to a ""pay-by-job"" rate. If you go down a WG, such as going WG30 down to WG10, then you get the highest pay available for WG10, but if you go up a WG such as WG30 to WG40 then you go to the lowest pay of that WG even if your normal pay is higher. The only reason im confident in saying this is because we experimented with this several months back and discovered that both scenarios (going up to WG40 and down to WG10) do exactly as I outlined.  In principle that should still be fine since you should be able to just keep the job as the default, while changing department to leadership and activity to leadership which then just flags the mix as bad and you just manually approve it, however market and corporate HR are cracking down on this and telling stores to stop doing this since it completely negates the flex pay and pay-by-job system.",kt8xjdt,comment,2024-03-03T22:33:46,t3_1b5aepu,t1_kt5epwt,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/1b5aepu/flex_pay_wage_groups_are_broken_for_aras/kt8xjdt/,BestBuyWorkers

"And therein lies the rub: it means that officially, ARAs can't skill up like advisors can. The equivalent for us would be if CIA was a non-permanent role like leads but since its not it means on paper we have no avenue. Again, I've personally accepted this simply because im treated as a defacto lead/mini-sup anyways, but it effectively leaves no mobility or opportunity for ARAs. I get that as a non-exempt job grade 8 we are looked at as a sort of lead for job grade 3/4 advisors vs 9 cia and 10-11 sups, but in practice job grades do little for ability and access.",kt8ycf1,comment,2024-03-03T22:39:33,t3_1b5aepu,t1_kt4n4bl,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/1b5aepu/flex_pay_wage_groups_are_broken_for_aras/kt8ycf1/,BestBuyWorkers

Most clients who come to us needing us to scan their laptop for viruses are people who ""need"" Geek Squad, so it makes more sense for them to get Total for $30 extra and have the freedom to connect to 24/7 support or bring their device back to the store at any point during their membership instead of paying $150 or more for us to help them one time.",ktkntp8,comment,2024-03-06T01:13:05,t3_1b7r86h,t3_1b7r86h,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/1b7r86h/it_is_really_necessary_to_have_a_best_buy_total/ktkntp8/,BestBuyWorkers
What it says on the website is right but it doesn‚Äôt mean that repair or data services are free. Consults are free but anything beyond that requires payment. That‚Äôs how it‚Äôs always been and how businesses run. Customers have the option to pay for each service a la carte or have most of them included in a yearly membership.,ktks9pv,comment,2024-03-06T01:59:22,t3_1b7r86h,t3_1b7r86h,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/1b7r86h/it_is_really_necessary_to_have_a_best_buy_total/ktks9pv/,BestBuyWorkers
Just don't do anything for free. Try to find a solution that helps the client but helps revenue in some way,ktkhtmf,comment,2024-03-06T00:17:47,t3_1b7r86h,t3_1b7r86h,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/1b7r86h/it_is_really_necessary_to_have_a_best_buy_total/ktkhtmf/,BestBuyWorkers
The marketing is bullshit. Everyone has access to in home services and it‚Äôs the same price for everyone. This is why in home services have flat lined since last july when total rolled out.,ktlhaza,comment,2024-03-06T06:52:53,t3_1b7r86h,t3_1b7r86h,/r/BestBuyWorkers/comments/1b7r86h/it_is_really_necessary_to_have_a_best_buy_total/ktlhaza/,BestBuyWorkers
