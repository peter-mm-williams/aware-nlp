I applied as an associate and was just wondering if this job is an enjoyable one. I‚Äôve worked at Kohls and Walmart in the past and both were hell.

33,"Just be careful.  BBY is one of the *better* options in working retail, but the company still sucks. I worked there in 2016-17 started in PT sales and worked my way up to FT sales lead until my role was discontinued 1 week into the position. The benefits are just okay and discount pretty generous. However, they focus very hard on unrealistic sales goals, management can be very pushy, and they restructure/eliminate positions/headcount ALL THE TIME.  &#x200B;  More recently, I returned to BBY part time in warehouse (1 day a week, just barely working enough for the discount), but later left just before the holiday season because I did not want to work anymore hours and they were really pressuring me to work. It was a bit more relaxed for me the second time around, mainly because it was 4 hours a week and I did not really care. Warehouse is still very metric/numbers driven, but it's different because you don't have to deal with customers as much, and most of the goals are pretty obtainable depending on how organized your warehouse team is. Although, it's almost impossible to move up in warehouse as your strengths don't show as much as they would in sales/customer service.  &#x200B;  That being said, it can be very easy to move up if you have a positive attitude, play the game of being peppy in their cringe company culture, and obtain/exceed your sales goals. With the turnover, you could land yourself a supervisor position in just a few years. Just don't be discouraged when they restructure and eliminate it, I can guarantee you at some point it will happen.  If you've worked for Walmart, I'm sure BBY is the better option, just learn to play their game. I could be wrong, but I would peg BBY to be in a similar line as Target & Starbucks in regards to quality of the company, but this is just observations and I could be wrong.  &#x200B;  I've also heard Costco has decent benefits, but can't speak to the internal workings of the company and culture. I did work for Apple Retail and really enjoyed working there and was sad when I left to work at a 'real job'.  &#x200B;  WDD",jfqvf59,"What are the unique challenges and opportunities you faced while working in sales and warehouse positions at BBY, and how did your experiences compare to working for Walmart, Target, or Starbucks?"
34,"This is my honest opinion I just recently left Best Buy after almost a year as part time computer sales. It has its ups and downs.  I found most of my coworkers to be incredible and people I still talk to now after leaving. The work can be easy on slow days as you‚Äôre just Downstocking and facing things.  But the worst part is management and metrics. Although your store may be different, this is just my experience, At my store, some associates are getting paid less then minimum wage. You get no incentive for pushing sales. You‚Äôre basically a scummy sales man. You push and push and if it doesn‚Äôt work you get reprimanded by management. Even having your hours cut down to 4 hours a week if you don‚Äôt meet your goals.  You don‚Äôt get recognized for your efforts but i understand that‚Äôs a lot of workplaces now. A lot of management were misogynistic and did not want to hire women.

93,"I am sorry to all of the workers that are gonna be affected by this. I know exactly how you feel. If you are bored enough to read my stupid life story:  I was part of the grand opening team for a Best Buy in 2006.  35,000 ft.¬≤ I was full-time media, basically a senior, but without the actual position or pay.  We had six managers, 12 supervisors, many seniors, and full timers.  I went through the reorg in 2009 and barely kept my position. Supervisors drop to five, managers drop to four.  My stress gave me ulcers.  Our goals got to unrealistic math levels.  In gaming we had to have 8% service plans, accessories 12.5%, 3% geek squad set up services for consoles ($30 to turn the system on and run updates lol).  I had done the math at the time and management was unpleasant with me when I said this was not possible. Nintendo Wii accessory sales when we had no wii remotes 70 nunchucks.  Assuming we literally sold geek squad, black tie protection on each possible device we would not hit our numbers.  And that‚Äôs assuming that customers come in and literally buy everything we tell them to.    Speaking of more unrealistic, I was told on a Monday morning to replace all of the price tag‚Äôs in gaming, because the wordage for performance replacement, plan (PRP) was rebranded to geek squad black-tie protection replacement plan (GSBTPRP).  I remember telling them that it wasn‚Äôt going to happen today and they got upset. Then I used math to show them that approximately 30 4ft sections of games, each having six shelves, minimum seven tags per row assuming that each game magically had its own spot on the shelf and wasn‚Äôt stacked in front of another game.  Telzon taking about 10sec per tag in our shitty faraday cage of a store.  Takes about 10 sec to remove old tag and put on new tag.  35 hours of labor assuming the tag printer doesn‚Äôt jam, zero customers need help, etc.  and all of this was less than 24 hours after an adset, so basically we had to redo adset is what corporate wanted.  management hated me.  Then there was the gaming initiative in 2011 where I was so optimistic that things were turning around.    At this point I was trying to raise a family and thought this would actually be my career. But then we didn‚Äôt receive enough labor for our team",jaxs9zv,"Based on the speaker's experience working at Best Buy from 2006 to 2011, what was the most challenging task they had to accomplish in terms of product labeling and rebranding, and how did they handle the situation when management disagreed with their assessment of the feasibility of the task?"
94,"thought this would actually be my career. But then we didn‚Äôt receive enough labor for our team full-time or had to work 32 1/2 hours supervisor 37 minimum.  We had two part-timers that got about 12 hours each.  Best Buy was talking about how bad shrink was and gaming, just like it always has been, and just like it always will be, but we did not have the labor to be staffed during each open hour.  Not to mention any labor for truck, adset, etc.  Then my position was removed August 2012.  The writing was on the wall.  I could either take severance or any of the available full-time positions that would exist.  Problem is there are three stores in our area, not counting the Best Buy mobiles.  So it was a dog pile of people for one or two positions that paid less than what we made five years ago at that point.    I took the severance, eight years of professional workmanship gone.  but a lot of my former friends and colleagues were still stuck on the Best Buy train wreck.  I joined this sub Reddit just to see how things have been going but it‚Äôs not very optimistic. Most of my bad dreams have been of regular work at Best Buy.  Now, almost everyone I know is out of Best Buy and has long since moved on. Years ago, Best Buy got rid of 401(k), matching I remember reading. Which is the most petty way of saying we don‚Äôt care about our employees and we are pretending that this is a cost savings measure.  The few old coworkers that remained said that they are sharing a manager between multiple stores. Almost nobody is full-time. They have like two supervisors. Which means some key holders are literally part time, so have no stake in the company.  All risk no reward.  Pay is capped at comical levels.  I just needed to get all that off my chest.

102,"I am a PC DA so this is going to be from a Geek Squad perspective, and it‚Äôs easier for me to sell because it‚Äôs usually cheaper to sell it than what the price of the job would be without TT, but I typically take the ‚Äúnot a salesy salesperson‚Äù approach because I don‚Äôt enjoy pushy salespeople.  In store, you could do this by explaining that TT includes discounts and since it covers services and labor on what they are purchasing, a new PC setup & migration in-store or in-home would be cheaper with TT, plus it includes a better warranty on most devices.   ‚ÄúWould you like me to have one of our Geek Squad agents come set up your new computer? They can transfer the data and make sure everything is working. If you have any questions a few weeks after using it, they can come back out. Typically appointments are $130+ per visit, but with TT, it would just be $200 for the entire year.‚Äù If they start to roll their eyes, I usually feel weird because sales feels gross, so I say, ‚ÄúI know, I have to mention it because it‚Äôs a really good deal,‚Äù and then I will just move right along.

I know salespeople in the store will mention my name when they offer in-home services; It may feel more personable that way. If you mention a specific agent with experience in what you‚Äôre client is purchasing, they may feel like they are getting the hook-up *(‚ÄúChristineth is our Apple guru so if you‚Äôre having iCloud issues, we could book an appointment for her to come sync your devices AND show you how to use this Apple Pencil I am selling you?‚Äù)* and it might help the client feel more comfortable with an agent coming out if they don‚Äôt typically utilize home services. *Hmm it‚Äôs just Christineth.

365,"I am in agreement!  It is very telling how badly workers have been groomed to default to freaking out and attacking one another on topics like this.  The folks that start calling for fellow humans to just ""work or leave"" have been lost to us and go out of their way to viciously defend corp and store leadership.  If they put that same energy into standing in solidarity with their fellow workers, we wouldn't even need a walkout of any kind.  Because if we did stand together we could actually be at the table.    I have had some very good times and met lots of friends and other cool people at BBY.  It has had times where they showed attempts at good-faith employee relations.  Also the point of said walkout is about those of us that actually care about making the company better.  The bootlickers yell ""don't like it, then leave!"" shit as if just finding a new job is like buying candy, and like we shouldn't be treated like humans.  Doing something like a walkout or forming a union is all what happens when the ""correct"" channels are taken but ignored.  They do so much that just counteracts everything we are constantly told.  We are the ones that have to deal with any and all customer/client rage and confusion that comes from badly setup ideas changing in ways that go against how large chunks of said shoppers/clients expect things.  Corp will just keep bad ideas going even if it is painfully obvious that it isn't working.  The folks that seem to make the plans are all super disconnected from the real world and real people (and I imagine they just want to speed up the latter fast enough to not be the one to deal with blow back).  If the stuff isn't working based on back and white metrics, it is us that are surely the issue and not their ""amazing idea"".    The current setup is based on trying to make more and more money than the record breaking years of 2020 and 2021 isn't sustainable.  Those years shouldn't be used in the same way that normal years are.  Sales went nuts because all of a sudden so many people had to quickly get or upgrade stuff to simply keep working and/or going to school.

366,"also means that projections for those services shouldn't keep planning for those numbers to keep growing instead of dropping.  So we see budgets slashed, things canceled, and lots and lots of workers laid off in desperate efforts to make the numbers look like things are still booming from a shareholders standpoint.  Which can only work for so long (especially if top people keep giving themselves higher and higher bonuses) before everything just falls apart dramatically.   If we didn't care, then obviously we would just leave.  We need things to be done in ways that work for both workers and the top.  If they are going to keep forcing us to watch lame elearnings about ""mental health importance"" and ""really caring about respecting each other"".  Then they could also start doing stuff that materially impacts workers lives in positive ways.  The ""customer obsession and building relationships"" nonsense is completely undermined by running everything so super lean in all departments.  Leaders freak the hell out if even two people are in a line, and just drag others that are already helping in some way into it.  But they could've allowed more people to be helped by getting in there and doing it themselves.  All that running around to find someone is time they could've just did it.  I hope that the stores that were the starting point of this walkout go through with it and in big numbers (I may if it happens in my area).  They can fire us all, but at a certain point it bites them hard if they were to do so.  All the extra and useless stuff needed to train new people has gotten so bad in some departments that it couldn't be done fast enough.

It sounds like your ""friend"" is a lazy person who demands special treatment already and your management most likely sees her work assignment as fitting compensation for her job performance, no matter how much longer she's been there than you. She can't do anything to you officially, but you may want to distance yourself from her as she may allow her frustration to motivate her to file false things about you, and if I read you correctly, she's already threatening you for making more.
