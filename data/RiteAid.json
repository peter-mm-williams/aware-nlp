I contacted customer service on Monday but I\u2019m no longer expecting a response at this stage. \n\nI have an rx for a med that is undergoing a shortage. RiteAid has had this rx since November. Every time I go in to pick up another med I ask, am told it\u2019s on order. \n\nI\u2019ve been getting by with samples from my MD but they are out. \n\nTwo weeks ago I was told that my store could get the med but I needed a new prior authorization. No problem, contacted my insurance, got the prior auth, went back to the store and was told again it was on back order. \n\nHere\u2019s where I get concerned. After speaking with the pharmacist I now suspect that the only times they are requesting the med from the distributor is on those days when I physically go to the store and request it be filled. \n\nDoes RiteAid continue to try to fill those back ordered prescriptions automatically or is it only when I request that they do so?\n\nI can understand if the store has been trying to fill the order automatically and just hasn\u2019t gotten any, but I\u2019m far less understanding if they are submitting just one order every month when I specifically ask about it. \n\nAny insight is appreciated.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/RiteAid\/comments\/12e9kvk\/rx_refill_process_question\/","reddit_title":"Rx Refill Process question","reddit_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RiteAid\/comments\/12e9kvk\/rx_refill_process_question\/","reddit_subreddit":"RiteAid","reddit_link_id":null,"reddit_parent_id":null,"reddit_submission":null},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2023-04-07T07:28:51","reddit_id":"jfazqv2","reddit_name":"t1_jfazqv2","reddit_created_utc":1680866931,"reddit_author":"thedukeofwhalez","reddit_text":"Couple of different ways to answer this, based on my experience. \n\nDepending on whether the backordered medication is a controlled drug, every pharmacy should be trying to order said med every week day, Monday thru Friday. Depending on the level of demand for the medication, the list of individuals looking for it could be anywhere from 10 to 100+ people (depending on how busy the pharmacy is and the length of time the medication has been backordered). With a script from November, its hard to believe they will ever fill your script because of its age and the expected number of new scripts coming in for the same medication on a daily basis.  \n\nRite Aid does have an auto order system for non-controlled medications and will continue attempting to order said med if there is a prescription for it in our active queue. The age of the script does apply though so its highly likely your script has fallen out of the order queue multiple times and you will always have trouble getting it, whether the store actually gets the medication or not, as you will always be battling with new scripts coming in for the same product.\n\nMy best recommendation: find a pharmacy that has it rather than waiting. The complete backorder issue has been going on for close to a year now with more medications falling into backorder every week. As annoying as it may be, asking the pharmacy staff to search other Rite Aids for the med may be your best option. And for you to begin calling other chains\/grocery pharmacies to see if they have it in stock, then calling your doctor to send the script there. As much as the staff would like to help you with this entire process, we desperately need help from patients during this time.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/RiteAid\/comments\/12e9kvk\/rx_refill_process_question\/jfazqv2\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"RiteAid","reddit_link_id":"t3_12e9kvk","reddit_parent_id":"t3_12e9kvk","reddit_submission":"12e9kvk"},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2023-04-07T07:55:24","reddit_id":"jfb2ac9","reddit_name":"t1_jfb2ac9","reddit_created_utc":1680868524,"reddit_author":"CaptThrowaway1","reddit_text":"Thank you, this is very helpful","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/RiteAid\/comments\/12e9kvk\/rx_refill_process_question\/jfb2ac9\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"RiteAid","reddit_link_id":"t3_12e9kvk","reddit_parent_id":"t1_jfazqv2","reddit_submission":"12e9kvk"},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2023-04-10T19:01:39","reddit_id":"jfrb56b","reddit_name":"t1_jfrb56b","reddit_created_utc":1681167699,"reddit_author":"StorytellingGiant","reddit_text":"Thank you so much for your reply! One point of clarification, if you have a moment. My prescription is currently on backorder and my technician said I \u201ccould\u201d call every day to check on the status. It sounded like it was optional (my rx is controlled, if that makes a difference) and having worked retail for many years in the past, I would never want to bug someone daily like that. \n\nMy prescription is controlled - am I working against myself by not checking every day, by losing my place in a queue? \n\nI have a friendly relationship with my Rite Aid folks and I\u2019d hate to become a nag, especially considering a lot of customers don\u2019t always treat staff with kindness. But it kinda sounds like I should suck it up and check every day.\n\nETA - strangely, Rite Aid called me just after I commented! My rx came in - no nagging from me needed.

If you do accept an ASM position make sure you make your goals known from the beginning you want to become an SM.  Anytime your DM comes in for a visit make sure you\u2019re there talking to them, getting your face and knowledge out there. Build a good rapport them and show them what YOU\u2019VE been achieving for the store.  If you\u2019re district has high turnover you could get a promotion easier than that. \n\nMy last piece of advice is to never take a store unless your at least 90% sure you want it.

The busier the store, the more difficult it will be. \n\nIm just a cashier but I have worked at 2 stores, a slow and a busy one. My first store was pretty slow and it closed down in May 2022. In the slow store the assistant managers jobs was a lot easier then in my new store. \n\nSince my old store was smaller, all the assistant did was set up seasonal aisles, work the load. Do zero counts, face, close or open store.  Receiving order etc, Pull report or just do whatever the manager instructed them.  If you are at a small store it\u2019s easier because it is less load that you willl receive. At my small store we would get like 5-10 pallets. \n\nMy new store is very busy and bigger than my previous. We have really good sales so we have 2 assistant managers and 1 store manager. It very busy so they are def needed. Anyways at this store we receive anywhere from 10- 20 pallets. The same tasks are done at this store they just take longer since the store is bigger and customers always bugging lol \ud83d\ude2d it\u2019s also annoying since my store is high they so lost if things are locked up. \n\nAssistant managers work usually work 9 hours. It can be a good stepping stone if you want to be a store manager in the future. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s the easiest job because I always see my assistant manager busting ass haha. The higher ups have their expectations  of what should be done. \n\nI have seen that the store closure have gone down a bit so I\u2019m hoping that means it\u2019s coming to an end.

Well Tuesday through Thursday I worked at different stores as my store didn\u2019t have the hours so I picked some up else where. I noticed that I wasn\u2019t feeling good about Wednesday evening and it got worse on the next two days. I actually ended up leaving the store I picked up a shift at on Thursday after catching them up with scripts early because I just could not handle it. Friday was my shift at my home store and I walk in early to get ready and get to talking with the other tech there and let her know that I wasn\u2019t feeling good and she told me the pharmacy manager had Covid. Apparently she tested positive that Tuesday and the whole store knew about it except me up until that Friday. Well I immediately got a test from the pharmacy through my insurance and I tested positive. I showed both the traveling pharmacist and the manager on duty and they told me that I had to go off for five days. I\u2019m a little agitated at the severe lack in communication as now I\u2019m off until the first of March when I could have tested sooner and returned sooner had they told me. About an hour later after I leave that same manager on duty also proceeded to text me that I also now need a doctors note for the five days so they will not be counted against a me. I mean they saw the positive test and clearly I got it from the pharmacist. I called my doctor and he was confused as to why a note was needed since the test was clearly positive and there are CDC protocols in place for this. He did give me a note but I was wondering should I say something to someone else about this? This has really left a bad taste in my mouth. I am already severely behind in my PTUs as I am hardly given an time to take them properly. I\u2019m considering taking classes outside of work to get my certification faster which I\u2019m told I can do just rite aide won\u2019t reimburse me for it. Should I call the union about this?\n\nUpdate: \n\nReturned to work and was let go. Go figure do what they tell me and they told me it was due to the absences. I said I had Covid with a note and was off like you told me to be and the store manager and pharmacy manager were just quiet.

My manager berated me twice in front of customers.  I wrote it in a little pocket sized book that I keep in my pocket.  For over an hour she just walked back and forth from her office to the service floor yelling at me and threatening me, right in front of customers.  She's done other things too, my union has multiple grievances filed against her on my behalf; but HR and regional manager haven't done anything.  So, today she just kept yelling at me.  If I was putting up tags she yelled at me for not getting to the register quickly enough to process sales.  If I stayed at the register she yelled at me for not putting up tags.  She yelled at me saying I was ignoring her but I had no idea which thing I was supposed to be doing.  I honestly starting to fear for my safety and thought about calling the police.  The assistant manager, and two cashiers are really good friends of hers, she knew them before she worked at Rite Aid, in fact she hired them.\n\nIn any case, I have no idea what to do about this woman.  HR and the Regional Manager are not an option to talk to, I've documented everything for months and they refuse to check stating it's too time consuming.  Besides the regional manager approved my write-up for not selling alcohol to someone without a license, he approved a write-up stating I confronted a customer when that customer went through the stock room and into the break room demanding his stuff, he approved a write-up for me objecting to non-safe things stating it's arguing with management, he approved a write stating I hadn't called in even though I had phone records to prove it.  So, HR and Regional Manager are definitely not people who actually look into a situation and try to verify things.  Once the HR manager told me it was \"too time consuming\" for him to verify something on videos.  And he approved me being written up when someone else wasn't doing her job and he refused to verify it on video.\n\nToday, I have no idea what set my manager off, but she did all the yelling and threatening write on the customer service floor, at the registers, even if customers were around.  And she denied me the right to have my union rep present, and she kept walking behind me brushing her shoulder against me in an unfriendly way, definitely in my space.  I honestly thought she was going to get violent.  I have no idea what to do since talking to the assistant manager won't help, the regional director and the union rep just don't care probably because I'm a lowly cashier and so easy to replace.

it has been a lower volume location.When I landed there in July 2018,it initially saw windfall from the closure of my previous store a mile up the road.The initial seeds my current store's woes were not only obviously planted with the new corporate regime,but also when my store's parent center changed ownership.Then almost as soon as 2020 began, neighboring tenants were booted out as part of planned center renovations which obviously got delayed(finally getting underway this past fall and still ongoing);and as the pandemic began raging,the company decided to systematically reduce many non-core merchandise categories which especially had a significant negative impact not only on my store but the West Coast Stores as a whole.First it merely empty aisles (whole or part),then they decided to partition off several back aisles.Complicating things is that in recent years they designated my store as a manager training store that changes managers every twelve months,and the store has systematically suffered since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.The store especially went downhill under our previous manager (no longer with the company)as several established employees hired under prior managers left and newer hires failed to stick.We recently gained several new colleagues (mostly management)from a recently closed store in the same district,but we are still behind and understaffed in the front end to the point that the store has been observing pharmacy hours for the past several weeks(there have been many instances this year that we've had to close early due to short staffing,not just on weekends;there were even occasional instances as early as memorial day weekend 2021).The new management team is feverishly trying to get the store at least back to the state it was at this point fifteen months ago;but it still seems that the my store's road to recovery (and future in general)is at whim of a corporate management that is dazed and confused,lacking a true credible plan to stem deepening losses.I'm still hopeful that that my store avoids the same fate as my prior store(closed over four years now)and is eventually remodeled into the new concept format (only California store with this format is a recently relocated Ventura area location),but it still feels like my store is by no means out of the woods considering that the new manager hasn't yet being allowed to hire new employees and labor coverage hours have been cut for weeks.Another problematic complication is an ongoing feud between the company and the parent center's property management since the center changed ownership. \n\nTo the right of this double wide aisle is the pharmacy and associated hba aisles.To the left are aisles that are mostly disused and shelved off(backroom extension)with only two aisles being merchandised for backroom and\/or restroom access.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/RiteAid\/comments\/y55jn1\/more_christmas_in_our_most_recent_truckloada\/isqwei6\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"RiteAid","reddit_link_id":"t3_y55jn1","reddit_parent_id":"t1_iso1mnd","reddit_submission":"y55jn1"},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2022-11-19T22:00:22","reddit_id":"ix1yl9b","reddit_name":"t1_ix1yl9b","reddit_created_utc":1668913222,"reddit_author":"AnxiousLeopard3446","reddit_text":"I

I have emailed the corporate fools once a week talked to dozens of non-store(corp) and store employees and said the same thing if you don't want shoplifting do as target does hire the nypd. There is one officer every time I walk into target\/cvs and there is little to no shoplifting or they get arrested.  Does rite aid do this...Nope they closed the walkable store closest to me and now the one I go to every time I walk in there is someone walking out with free stuff and while shopping  I see peeps just stuffing their bags and walking out without paying. Or I can't get the item I want it's behind a door now and try to get someone with a key ha they still steal. You would not have lost as much as you would have paid the nypd.  It seems they just don't care for their customers but every time I go to rite aid they never have the thing I want on sale or no sale. So sooner or later unless they smarten up ill just stop shopping and they will have a real reason to shut stores and no customers.

I am unable to leave my house easily, so I've been using the Rx delivery with Riteaid the last couple years. A week or so ago, when I tried to checkout my Rx, I noticed the checkout process had changed and there were some bugs preventing me from doing so. My pharmacy informed me that the system is down, and no one can get the Rx delivered right now, and Riteaid has given them no info on when it might be restored. It's been a little over a week now, and though you can get a little further in the checkout process, it's still not possible to complete it.\n\nI was just curious if this is currently the case with all RiteAid pharmacies, or only some? And if anyone might have details on if\/when Riteaid might be restoring the services? I am starting to run really low on my medication, and I'm trying to figure out if I will need to transfer them until it's solved. (Unfortunately Riteaid is the only pharmacy in my little town, so transferring them long distance for mail delivery is a little complicated.) My local pharmacy is wonderful, and everyone that works there is great, so I would prefer to wait it out and stay there, I just won't have an option if the upgrade is something that will take several weeks or longer.\n\nSorry for bugging you and appreciate any info in advance, if you have it.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/RiteAid\/comments\/y0gwxm\/riteaid_mobile_rx_delivery_question_sorry\/","reddit_title":"Riteaid mobile Rx delivery question (sorry)","reddit_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RiteAid\/comments\/y0gwxm\/riteaid_mobile_rx_delivery_question_sorry\/","reddit_subreddit":"RiteAid","reddit_link_id":null,"reddit_parent_id":null,"reddit_submission":null},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2022-10-10T22:57:49","reddit_id":"irufr8b","reddit_name":"t1_irufr8b","reddit_created_utc":1665457069,"reddit_author":"Squemishsquash","reddit_text":"I have no idea about any rx stuff since im a front end worker, not a pharmacy worker.

Rite Aid is definitely the best overall, we just have really stupid corporate people. As the last person said, it all depends on the store and RPL (your boss). Definitely expect anywhere from 8-12hr shifts, and you will be given your base hours with your offer. Meaning, if you at a FT hourly pharmer, you will get X-amount of hours guarenteed on a biweekly pay schedule. If you are PT hourly, you may find some weeks with plenty of hours and others with a few shifts. Id ask your RPL for more information before accepting but overall, Id like to say youll enjoy your experience far more with Rite Aid compared to the other retail giants. Regarding overtime, another thing to ask about as they may make you salary with a (for example) 86hr base, and you are always able to work more but it will not be overtime pay.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/RiteAid\/comments\/xwp6ak\/would_you_accept\/ir8aoog\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"RiteAid","reddit_link_id":"t3_xwp6ak","reddit_parent_id":"t3_xwp6ak","reddit_submission":"xwp6ak"},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2022-10-05T20:59:41","reddit_id":"ir847x2","reddit_name":"t1_ir847x2","reddit_created_utc":1665017981,"reddit_author":"Squemishsquash","reddit_text":"unfortunately im not a pharmacist but theres only two things i can really answer and one advice, as for hours it varies from store to store, some stores are open 24\/7 and some are only open 9-9.

I may be wrong but i do believe your shifts will be 12 or 10 hours long as the pharmacist (i dont know if that's how it is for all pharmacist positions so i figured id mention it) you may be requested to go to a different store if they're under staffed, i know we have 2 pharmacists that fill in at our store when they were hired at another. again its a location kind of thing. Any other job related questions would probably be best answered if you called the store you for the offer from and asked your questions or even going in there to talk with them in person, maybe get a read on who youd be working with very briefly.

I certainly provided the patient care I wanted to provide personally but I never felt like the company actually stood behind me and promoted that. Example: CVS is bonkers for metrics and their numbers. If you didnt meet numbers, you were punished with incredible hour cuts and your DL treating you like trash (went through 3 DLs, 3 totally different areas, all the same narrative). I felt like I couldnt provide the patient care I wanted because it would put me so far back on my work and I would just screw myself in the end trying to do what I originally sought out to do as a pharmacist. \n\nI went to Rite Aid and I feel I have the autonomy to do what I feel is best for both the pharmacy and my patients. The company provides metrics to aim for but I have yet to hear a single region of Rite Aid where people were actively scrutinized for not making goal. I have only heard positive promotion of metrics and the acceptance of new ideas and curiosities on how to make a bigger difference for patients (and employees), rather than how we can improve numbers and make more money for the big wigs. \n \nPros: Freedom to practice as a pharmacist and not a robot. Not suffocated with numbers. (Personally) RPLs that actually care for you as a person rather than just another jabroni. Actually feel fulfilled by the work I do. \nCons: Systems great but has a lot to improve on. Leaps and bounds behind CVS when it comes to standard operating procedures and efficiency in workflow (This being said, in only a year they have eliminated about half of the problems I originally had when I transitioned over). \n\nYou could hear the exact opposite of this from someone else tho so take the offer seriously but feel out what you personally want with your career.

It's clear that you have absolutely no idea what they actually do behind the counter. I'm sure to most people it seems like it should be easy to have someone do these things but they're trying to do so much at once, doing the job of 3 people as 1 person. It's sad and most of the Pharmacy staffs are burnt out, fed up, and exhausted of people thinking they're not doing enough when they're typically working their asses off. There's never even supposed to be only 1 person in the pharmacy. The demands of the job went up significantly since covid, do you know how many covid shots and tests they do a day? How much paperwork and time that is on top of everything else, on top of flu shot season? Saying 1 person can do shot, scripts, drive through and phones is a little fucking ridiculous. Do you even realize the absolute outrage they would get for making a drive through exclusive to any demographic. As if they aren't getting enough from people who want to sit here and complain but don't pay attention or care that yes their meds are important but these people are also just PEOPLE,  they're not robots. \n\nEvery store in my region is down to 1 pharmacist because the incoming pharmacist take one look what the job really is and quit. In my store it's just a pharmacist and 2 techs. They're there 6 days a week working 50 hours and JUST at my store. Then they're being scheduled elsewhere. My pharmacist was scheduled 14 days in a row for 10 hour shifts a day. Yet they still deal with ignorant customers screaming at them that they aren't doing enough, that they're going to sue them, THREATENING THEIR LIVES. Have an ounce of sympathy for these people and stop demanding more. That or quietly go somewhere else.

I knew how burned out they ALL were - as I mentioned they were approximately the fourth staff walk out in about a decade. I felt very badly for ALL of them. Because I\u2019m there so often I became very close with every staff that\u2019s been there for the last fourteen years, but especially so with the last staff of three Pharmacists, two techs and two assistants. (well, one left one is still there)  \n  \nI\u2019ve praised Pharmacists Sharon and Joe, and Tech Kiersten in many reviews  - because despite the enormous pressure and stress   - they were always kind, courteous and efficient. Sharon would be swamped yet she still managed to be proactive and took care of any issues before they became actual problems. \n  \nNot only did I speak with them at length about the issues they were having - I talked about it in my previous post.  \nI was acutely aware how poorly they were treated: they were absolutely overworked, underpaid and understaffed. I saw it first hand - since I\u2019d pick up medications 3-4 times a month - so I always made a point to never keep them on the phone or at the drive through one second more than necessary. \n  \n**THIS IS MY MAIN POINT:**   \nOn too many occasions over the years they were totally UNDERSTAFFED: with just two people most of the day - down to one during lunch and breaks - and just one person for the night shift from 6-9pm. Yet despite this - they NEVER stopped answering phones and NEVER shut down the drive through. They not only managed somehow, but they were always pleasant and helpful, so much so, you\u2019d never know the tremendous pressure they were under and feeling. I know the Rx Refill time went from 20 mins - to 45 - to 60  - and then 2-4 hours\u2026.if it\u2019s not urgent, the next day  - and I\u2019m fine with that.\n  \n\n  **AND PROBLEM**\nAnd as 90% of my medications are schedule ll, they can\u2019t be delivered. And that wasn\u2019t even the biggest problem - I could try and get someone occasionally to pick them up - it\u2019s that I MUST speak with someone there when problems arise - and or when I have questions- which unfortunately happens a lot with my many Doctors - so if they don\u2019t answer the phone - then I am forced to drive (which is painful) down there - but without a drive through - I now have to get out and walk which hurts even more - then wait in line.   \n  \nAll of that is avoidable if they\u2019d picked up the phone.   \n  \nSo again, as I\u2019ve mentioned several times, the staff HAS OPTIONS other than not answering the phone and closing down the drive through. Especially when this began so soon after they started, before they had tried anything else:  \n  \n\u2022The staff knows when it\u2019s busiest, so they can communicate the best times to call back and asks people to do just that if it can wait.  \n\u2022They can delay the pick up times: put signs up letting people know they may have to wait longer than usual at the drive through (it was already up to 20-30 mins at times during the day, so I always came very early to late) or in line, and ask if they can pick it up during the times it\u2019s the least busiest - or the next day.  \n\u2022Answer the phone, ask if it\u2019s something quick, if not they may have a longer hold time, or if possible to call back during the hours it\u2019s the least busy.  \n\u2022Contact one of the staff members that just quit - and get some advice.  \n\u2022Contact the Manager that hired you and tell them the staff shortage is so unmanageable that you\u2019re forced to close the drive through and are unable to answer phones. If they don\u2019t do anything - call Corporate.   \n\u2022It\u2019s SO EASY to be an Anonymous Whistleblower- start reaching out and get this in the NEWS NOW. Or things will NEVER change.  \n\u2022Tell the Customers where they can call or email to complain to get things changed.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/RiteAid\/comments\/xe7dja\/update_san_rafael_northgate_pharmacy_05958_is\/ipfybod\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"RiteAid","reddit_link_id":"t3_xe7dja","reddit_parent_id":"t1_iojfxmw","reddit_submission":"xe7dja"},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2023-01-23T17:07:33","reddit_id":"j5lpsji","reddit_name":"t1_j5lpsji","reddit_created_utc":1674511653,"reddit_author":"teforte","reddit_text":"Wrong, that line is working fine.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/RiteAid\/comments\/xe7dja\/update_san_rafael_northgate_pharmacy_05958_is\/j5lpsji\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"RiteAid","reddit_link_id":"t3_xe7dja","reddit_parent_id":"t1_j33g8gv","reddit_submission":"xe7dja"},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2023-02-08T11:07:42","reddit_id":"j7pxsqy","reddit_name":"t1_j7pxsqy","reddit_created_utc":1675872462,"reddit_author":"Obvious_Advantage_22","reddit_text":"It was not working, sounds like it is now.

I hate working there, but as a member of management, I feel like I can't leave. Our manager was out for a month, when they came back, I was blamed for stuff like a lack of productivity. I had a planned vacation about a month ago, but had to fight to actually get it. I was told that because one of the supervisors that's out on leave couldn't come back when they expected, my vacation would have to wait. Over a year of frustration kind of exploded inside me and I went off on our manager. In the end, I took my vacation. But I had to come back to a place a despise.

Manager pay on the east coast is absolutely ass. In fact, pay for every position is abysmal. Bonuses are not existent or if you do manager to get one, it\u2019s so insubstantial that it\u2019s more of a slap in the face. My store beats plan constantly but was still cut 50 hours from payroll with this recent company wide initiative from corporate to try and save money to beat ETIBA. We now have 140 payroll hours a week to split between everyone (besides store manager) at my store. Which means there are 4 hours where we have no cashier, so the manager or shift manager is stuck up front the entire time but still expected to get the same amount of work done as if we had a cashier the entire time. In fact, the work load has increased so much since our hours have been cut. You can take a 15 for lunch but if you take a 30 you have to clock out. The expectations right now are grossly unrealistic with what we are given to work with, and everything feels like an uphill battle because corporate is constantly changing their minds, making you redo things because they decided to do it differently or because they sent you the wrong stuff. My manager and I always say \u201cit\u2019s not Rite unless you do it twice\u201d. Corporate shows no empathy and will treat you like dirt. A lot of long time, loyal managers have actually been defecting for places like CVS and Kroger because they feel that Corporate is trying to find reasons to get rid of them or is putting them in situations to where they feel they have no option but to quit. I just know that if I, someone who has been a shift manager and then assistant manager for over ten years with rite aid, was offered a store manager position, I wouldn\u2019t take it.

I am LIVID!!\n\nIt\u2019s ALWAYS the same thing and it COULD have been avoided if RiteAid Management had treated them better!!  \nCorporate RiteAid has the WORST reputation - all you have to do is read the endless litany of complaints.  \nNone of the individual stores list names and contact information for ANY Pharmacy Staff much less the Regional or District Managers. \n\nWhy?  \ud83e\udd14  \nBecause of their high turnover and the fact that they\u2019ll be inundated with complaints! It\u2019s rarely about an employee, it\u2019s due to all the issues caused by understaffing (as most customers are now keenly aware) as Corporate bends and ignores H.R. Laws and Rules, driving them into the ground from massive stress.\n(And you rarely saw more than 1-2 Main Store employees.)\n\nThey NEVER hire the adequate number of employees required to function normally and within the law.\ud83d\ude33  \n\nThere\u2019s rarely enough people to even cover their State mandated breaks and lunch- which they often skip- otherwise too many customers medications wouldn\u2019t get them filled till the next day. They are spread so thin they barely have a moment to breathe. Over time they\u2019ve been slowly crushed under the pressure and stress of an impossible work load.  \n\n**QUESTIONABLE PRACTICES:**. \nI pick up medications twice a month and shop there regularly. Before when I had an issue or allergy with a generic, my Dr. would note the exception, and they\u2019d order the brand name. This was crucial as the Rhodes brand Oxycodone does not relieve pain and has lots of side effects - I suspect caused by the numerous fillers, as many were listed as toxic substances. (FDA ) Later Corporate said they would no longer pay the shipping cost, so I paid it. Finally last year Corporate told the staff they could no longer order any \u201cexceptions\u201d and were limited to their stock.  \n  \nThe Pharmacist said they had a new exclusive contract with Rhodes for Oxycodone - at a dirt cheap price - for monthly bulk amounts. But because so many customers complained they didn\u2019t work, and had been choosing to pay for the brand name, there was a lot of extra stock and they weren\u2019t ordering from Rhodes as often, so the numbers were falling below the minimum amount agreed upon. I called CVS, Walgreens, Target, Safeway and Costco - they ALL had the same exclusive contract with Rhodes.  \n\nSo Rhodes, who\u2019s owned by Purdue, had organized an illegal Monopoly.  \n\nAnd Rite Aid, by refusing customers a choice, is forcing a basically worthless substandard medication on their customers. There are blogs, message boards and tons of comments on websites like Drugs dot com filled with the exact same complaints about Rhodes Oxycodone, mainly: No pain relief, a placebo is stronger, negative side effects and overall suffering.\nThanks RiteAid Corporate.  \n  \nBack to the Staff:  \nNo matter the time of day - they are busy from the second they arrive. Four years ago the average wait for a prescription was 20-30 minutes. Two years ago it was 45-60 minutes. Within the last year it\u2019s now 1.5 -4 hours. \ud83d\ude33  \n  \nWhy? \ud83e\udd14  \nBecause they started offering on site Covid Testing and Vaccines \u2026.in addition to Flu Shots\u2026.  \non a walk in basis or by appointment. Corporate placed this additional work load on an already heavily burdened staff, (more like a Skeleton Crew\u2026) \u2026WITHOUT BOTHERING TO HIRE ANY EXTRA PEOPLE. \n\nThe Staff that just quit were absolutely FANTASTIC. \ud83e\udd73  \nSharon, Joe and Kiersten were the BEST of the bunch. And Rita, Kathy and Jack before them.\nThey were the most caring and hard working\u2026.able to smile and were friendly despite the enormous volume of work and the phone ringing from open to closing.  \n  \nThey consistently went above and beyond to help. Given the lack of customer service with most stores, I wouldn\u2019t dread calling or having to interact when picking up my medications  (like with most stores lately) knowing I\u2019d be well taken care of.\n\nTheir new employers are VERY LUCKY.  \n\nI\u2019ll be switching soon\u2026\u2026.\ud83d\ude45\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/RiteAid\/comments\/wblmkm\/entire_pharmacy_dept_quit_northgate_branch_san\/","reddit_title":"\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0fENTIRE PHARMACY DEPT QUIT!

I looked at them weird because I'm literally new. I declined. They needed to fill a position because the last supervisor got fired.  They asked an 18 year old with no job experience, came in same time as me, her first job ever, to become a supervisor. She said yes. She was like \"I can't believe they asked me!\" I'm like \"They asked me too.. I declined.\" Lol, Not trying to be mean but she was just the only one willing to say yes.\n\nHonestly, they are just desperate. I still think it's weird I have to listen to someone 10 years younger than me and I personally think she's bad at managing. How do you ask someone to be a shift lead supervisor who literally never had job experience before and only been there a couple months? It's just strange to me. Plus, cashiers can literally do what managers\/supervisors do, because at my  Rite Aid the managers ask cashiers to help out with their duties. The only thing we can't do is count drawers, open the lottery machine, and obviously use the manager fingerprint access (and probably other paperwork that cashiers aren't allowed to fill out).\n\nBasically, my point is, they are desperate to just fill in the position it doesn't matter your credentials. There's an older lady that's been there longer at my store (3+ years) and they asked her too. She declined. The hours suck.  Yeah you get more responsibilities but you also get more crap and hours that are crazy. I don't care what anyone says,  I believe in work\/life balance and I'll leave right around the time I'm supposed to. Expect to never call off either as they definitely expect way more out of you as a supervisor. I've seen it first hand watching the 18 year old get trained.\n\nI personally believe you should be at the store for at least a year before going in that role but as I've said before, they are desperate to hire a body in as well as literally anybody. Even if you never had a job before. That shows how desperate and backwards Rite Aid is.\n\nYou'll be happier being a cashier. You just do what they tell you and bugger off. And at least you'll have 3-4 cashiers that \\*could\\* cover with less anguish and guilt if you call out vs the supervisor who will get more looks and guilt if they call out as well as it be harder for another manager to come in and take over.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/RiteAid\/comments\/vnyie4\/im_applying_to_be_a_retail_supervisor_what_can_i\/iei008j\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"RiteAid","reddit_link_id":"t3_vnyie4","reddit_parent_id":"t3_vnyie4","reddit_submission":"vnyie4"},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2022-06-30T14:45:56","reddit_id":"iecoxlo","reddit_name":"t1_iecoxlo","reddit_created_utc":1656614756,"reddit_author":"WorkerNo5412","reddit_text":"Do you think I should ask just to be a cashier?","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/RiteAid\/comments\/vnyie4\/im_applying_to_be_a_retail_supervisor_what_can_i\/iecoxlo\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"RiteAid","reddit_link_id":"t3_vnyie4","reddit_parent_id":"t1_iec4xgf","reddit_submission":"vnyie4"},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2022-07-01T17:10:09","reddit_id":"iei1qqq","reddit_name":"t1_iei1qqq","reddit_created_utc":1656709809,"reddit_author":"WorkerNo5412","reddit_text":"Don't worry, I followed you guys stories and I decided to become a cashier instead no contact me then other jobs would be more suitable than this","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/RiteAid\/comments\/vnyie4\/im_applying_to_be_a_retail_supervisor_what_can_i\/iei1qqq\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"RiteAid","reddit_link_id":"t3_vnyie4","reddit_parent_id":"t1_iei008j","reddit_submission":"vnyie4"},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2022-06-30T14:53:14","reddit_id":"iecq26g","reddit_name":"t1_iecq26g","reddit_created_utc":1656615194,"reddit_author":"matt211","reddit_text":"You could, unfortunately, I believe that if your store is like mine the positions that they're looking to fill are supervisor positions.

However the base pay rate was raised $4.72 which from what I was making before is \\~32% increase in pay. Now I thought initially that this was probably some one time covid bonus and there was no way Rite Aid of all companies was giving me a permanent pay raise outside the normal yearly 2%. However when I was able to check my paystub for the upcoming pay period the new base pay rate was still applied and I received significantly more money this time around. \n\nI'm just curious if anyone else has received something like this recently? Did anyone get a letter in the mail about this? I haven't checked the Spot of all places so I don't know\/think there is a message there. Nothing on my work email either. One of my pharmacists said they received letters about a 1 time bonus to expect in May, but as a tech I don't recall seeing this so I believe it was a pharmacist thing. I don't want to tell my coworkers about it. I told my PIC about it and he didn't seem to know anything other then a probable performance review or something. Just wondering is all. \n\nI hope I don't sound like I'm spiraling or panicking. However it's Rite Aid, and a retail pharmacy job to boot. I've only been with Rite Aid for 2.5 years. I plan on talking to HR about this, but I also don't want to lose the money if it indeed is a mistake even though I'd have to pay the money back if it's found out lol.

At the beginning of the current fiscal year the company announced they wanted all stores to be inventoried between the months of May and June. This is regardless of  whether or not a store just had inventory. They have upped our strip and wax  floor service from 1x a year to 4x a year. All managers received bonuses and raises in our district. This is abnormal. Just this past week we had two different conference calls that cut our hours drastically. We were told that this would last for 8 weeks .On a side note I work in a West Coast store. There are a lot of differences with California stores and the rest of the stores. A lot of the stores in California are unionized and of course they have to follow a different set of laws. During these conference calls it was almost even encouraged to have employees lie about meal penalties. In California if you do not get a lunch prior to 5 hours the company has to pay you one hour of regular time. If you're looking for another lawsuit this is how you get another lawsuit . The current company standard that came out is they want only two employees in the morning and two employees in the evening. Unlike stores in other states most stores in California have a hand dip ice cream dept. We also have other services like propane exchange, passport photos, photo printing and several stores have locking cases for liquor and other merchandise. Having only two people in the store is providing 0 level of customer service so I'm not sure what the company's thought processes is on this. When this was announced all the stores forecasted sales were reduced in the system. I can only imagine it was to give the perception for the reason of the reduced labor hours. There was a store in our district they announced would be closing, there was no outward announcement and literally two weeks notice. The oddest part to me was they were telling Pharmacy customers to take their scripts to the nearest pharmacy, not even telling them to take it to the nearest Rite Aid Pharmacy. The company has taken a downward spiral ever since the new CEO took over. I have zero faith in her ability to build the growth of this company and I'm starting to question her intentions. We are either being set up to go bankrupt or be sold but I imagine we'll know in the next 2 months.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/RiteAid\/comments\/ukrreh\/something_is_off_with_this_company\/","reddit_title":"Something is off with this company.","reddit_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RiteAid\/comments\/ukrreh\/something_is_off_with_this_company\/","reddit_subreddit":"RiteAid","reddit_link_id":null,"reddit_parent_id":null,"reddit_submission":null},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2022-05-08T02:11:57","reddit_id":"i7rom1c","reddit_name":"t1_i7rom1c","reddit_created_utc":1651990317,"reddit_author":"None","reddit_text":"[deleted]","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/RiteAid\/comments\/ukrreh\/something_is_off_with_this_company\/i7rom1c\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"RiteAid","reddit_link_id":"t3_ukrreh","reddit_parent_id":"t3_ukrreh","reddit_submission":"ukrreh"},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2022-05-07T23:14:10","reddit_id":"i7r7651","reddit_name":"t1_i7r7651","reddit_created_utc":1651979650,"reddit_author":"MoxieFloxacin","reddit_text":"Bro this is RA.

(still trading under ML Capital Group, Inc. \\[OTC:MLCG\\] pending FINRA approval of name and ticker symbol change) announced they will host a webinar to explain the terms of Spear Point's recent proposal to acquire Rite Aid Corporation in a take-private transaction valued at approximately $3.6 billion, including long-term debt, not including operating leases.\n\nFundamental to that proposal, Spear Point noted that its data valuation and monetization partner, Silverback, has made a preliminary determination that Rite Aid's data may have significant value that could exceed the equity value of the company. In its Term Sheet, Spear Point offered to enlist Silverback's services to value Rite Aid's data as part of its due diligence process. Furthermore, Spear Point offered to share that valuation with the board of Rite Aid and allow the company to seek a higher value after the data valuation had been presented. Rite Aid refused that offer.\n\nTherefore, on April 28, 2022, Spear Point and Silverback will host a joint webinar in which the Spear Point team will walk webinar participants through its Term Sheet, and give insights into its strategic vision for Rite Aid. Silverback will present its data valuation methodology and monetization strategy that underpins the transaction's value proposition. Interested parties can register for the \"Twitter Spaces\" webinar at: [https:\/\/silverbackinc.com](https:\/\/stats.newswire.com\/x\/html?final=aHR0cHM6Ly9zaWx2ZXJiYWNraW5jLmNvbS8&hit%2Csum=WyIzaG5hZHoiLCIzaG5hZTAiLCIzaG5hZTEiXQ) or [https:\/\/twitter.com\/i\/spaces\/1YqGopapwzjJv](https:\/\/stats.newswire.com\/x\/html?final=aHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS9pL3NwYWNlcy8xWXFHb3BhcHd6akp2&hit%2Csum=WyIzaG5hZTIiLCIzaG5hZTMiLCIzaG5hZTEiXQ)\n\n\"We would like to invite Rite Aid's shareholders, stakeholders, and management to join us in a discussion about why we think Rite Aid is significantly undervalued and explore management's inability to unlock that value. We would also welcome Rite Aid CEO Heyward Donigan or any other member of the company's senior management to join us to explain the company's position on the proposed offer and how they expect to create significant shareholder value in the coming years. Because, obviously, the only logical reason to not even explore our proposal would be that they have a superior plan to create even greater shareholder value. I would love to hear it, as I suspect shareholders would.

This has reduced the number of people who regularly shop at drugstores.

There were 37,918 complaints of retail theft citywide in 2019 and 43,864 such complaints in 2021 \u2014 an increase of about 15%. (There were 32,358 retail theft complaints in New York City in 2020, when much of the city was shut down due to the pandemic.) Complaints are not a perfect measure of crime trends because not all thefts are reported. But it is certainly a more rigorous metric than Michael Rapaport's Instagram account.\u00a0  \nThe 15% increase in retail theft complaints comes in the context of a [dramatic decrease](https:\/\/email.mg2.substack.com\/c\/eJwlkM2OhCAMx59muA0RAcUDh73saxiE6rCLYPhY49tvnUmatrS0f_hZU2FL-dJHKpXcbq7XATrCWQLUCpm0Ann2TotxEHwYCWaOKamIL_OaAXbjg665ATnaErw11ad4D7BhEOSl7cLWVQ3C8albJmmlHIfOCc7ZygW3y0fVNOchWtDwB_lKEUjQr1qP8uBfj_4b7TxPRuNl6Zb-8GhKgVowidfhMLh0xpCMu0uHW9Hb7HeYS8UHlert3bDlCfHZytP6elG8Rrzuux6NCcZ4JxTt6cDAScXxl90KYy-o3KZBhld-iG7felragkvtL7VpJ1n_7ClWjz2TwruEGGaMe4soMkM0SwD3IVQ_nN_M5g0iZOTvZlMRlhCKq15Nkk0fJDdzNXZq4oygpks4FXHB0YLJPq4p72_W_5_5mS8) in crime, including more serious property crimes that impact retailers, in New York City. In 2001, there were 27,873 robbery complaints in New York City, and last year the city had 13,831 robbery complaints. In 1990, there were over 100,000 robbery complaints.  \nOverall, felony crimes in New York City are down 36.6% since 2001 and 80.5% since 1990. All crime is a problem but, overall, crime is much less of a problem in New York City than it has been in the recent past.\u00a0  \n**Rite Aid's (alleged) crime spree**  \nWhile a man stealing shampoo and condoms from Rite Aid attracted extensive media coverage, Rite Aid's alleged illegal exploitation of its own workers has received scant attention.

The median Rite Aid employee, however, makes just $33,212 annually. When the company steals hundreds or thousands of dollars in wages from its employees, it has a real impact on workers who are struggling to make ends meet.  \n**Stealing wages is a bigger problem than stealing shampoo**  \nThe settlements by Rite Aid and other corporations for wage theft represent just a small fraction of the problem. Federal enforcement of wage theft falls under the purview of the Wage and Hour Division (WHD) of the U.S. Department of Labor.

I hadn't brought his cards because i had gotten a call from the automated system stating that the scripts were done. I said I would come back with the information at a later date, but wanted to get the antibiotics. I was then told none of the scripts were done. They need more information. I returned today only to find that the information need is from the Dr. not me and the prescriptions for my dad were done just after 3:30 yesterday. I was really upset, had they told me it would only be a couple of mins for the meds I would have waited for them to finish as he has pneumonia. They decided to argue with me today instead of listening to the fact that they were in the wrong and saying they were sorry for the problem. I was also told that the automatic phone system isn't always right about prescriptions be done. What go is a system if it isn't correct? They have had they script in the store since, 12\/1\/2021, this is now 12\/4\/2021, I think they are being paid to let people know if there is a problem with prescription in a timely manner and we should have been called to know that there was a problem long before I went into the store the first time on 12\/3\/2021.

All depends on your district manager. Each one obsesses over something different. In region A they may get on everyone\u2019s case about seasonal decorations like it\u2019s the only important thing in the world, in region B you might get a DM who freaks out because not every customer was greeted with a loud \u201cHI WELCOME TO RITE AID!\u201d as they walked through the door. Region C might be a policy wonk who just wants to see a paper trail of everything forever, with every void receipt saved until someday. Region D might have a former SM who \u201cgets\u201d it and is totally chill. \n\nMy DM is understaffed for store managers, and he\u2019s constantly moving us around to get coverage where needed. Other districts may be better.\n\nThey ask for more paper records than any company I\u2019ve ever worked for. It\u2019s so wasteful. Some of the auto-generated reports will be fifty pages long and literally no one will ever look at them ever. And if they needed to, it\u2019s in the system and there\u2019s no reason to print them to begin with. They just wind up in boxes in the storage room until someone comes to shred them. \n\nA lot will depend on the store you train at and the store you get. I felt like my training was good until I actually was placed in a store, and found everything I hadn\u2019t been trained on. It wasn\u2019t a real codified training system. There\u2019s all kinds of RiteAid lingo that\u2019s never explained. You just kind of shadow another manager for a month\u2026 and if they\u2019re cutting corners (and we all do) suddenly on your first official day there\u2019s things you\u2019ve never heard of coming up that you need to be in compliance on. So you have to ask a LOT of questions of your training manager, to really make sure you\u2019re not missing anything. \n\nThe store you get may be great. It may already run on auto-pilot, or it may be a mess that they expect you to bring into compliance. That\u2019s what happened to me, it was really sink or swim right out of the gate.\n\nThat aside, decent starting salary.

Knowing how Shorts have done everything in their power to drive AMC into Bankruptcy, all in the effort to collect a windfall from the misery of others losing their jobs and their business livelihood. Well it just puts a smile on my face. Those Shorts trapped themselves, but I can see why Shorts thought AMC was easy pray. Shorts saw a wounded company and said, \"How fortuitous. I can profit from AMC's death and feast off their demise.\" I have watched many other good  American companies fall prey to Short attacks without so much as whisper as they gave up the ghost. So to see AMC Retail holders fighting back just makes me smile all the more. I invested in Rite Aid when I saw this same approach. You see for me it just didn't mathematically add up.  Shorts are losing hundreds of millions on shorting RAD also. That's a fact. A little simple math tells you the truth. Shorts can't cover and short more RAD at the same time. Especially when RAD's price  movement shows the opposite. With just what is reported RAD short interest data. In order for Shorts to cover 7.7 million RAD shares. Covering RAD at $19 will cost Shorts $145 million. Now add $32 you get $233 million. At $40 it's $300 million. You can see with this trend what would happen at $80. Now for anyone who thinks these Shorts are not desperate and trapped. After RAD 1 share for 20 reverse split in 2019 it's mathematically impossible. For over 2 years now I have invested in RAD on this premise. You see before RAD split Shorts were negative 200 million RAD shares. This is huge outlay cash. This is how I know it's a Big Money Shorts and not just a few Retail Shorts. Shorts have made no progress in covering RAD since back in early February of this year and that's when RAD was $32. There's also a few other things to consider with RAD. There have been two buyout attempts within 4 years. RAD does $24 Billion in revenue and their market cap is less than $1 Billion. That's a huge revenue gain for someone. RAD has a $400 million Free Cash Flow potential with the right management. Now anyone following the market news may have seen the story that Amazon is thinking about a physical space of their Amazon Pharmacy's. I think it could also be a reason why Amazon separated out Amazon Pharmacy from Amazon. Pill Pack was seems like total failure. Amazon knows it needs physical locations to make a  real  attempt in offering a Pharmacy solution. With Amazon Pharmacy being separate. It's no way the FTC can say no to a merger  of Amazon Pharmacy and America's third largest Pharmacy. When Rite Aid bought Bartells Pharmacy last year and paid cash by the way. It made me think that this could be a match. I believe Shorts are just as trapped inside of RAD as they are in AMC or GME. Of course these are only my opinion and not any investment recommendations, but I really wanted to see what others might think.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/RiteAid\/comments\/nmxa89\/shorts_trapped_themselves\/","reddit_title":"Shorts Trapped Themselves","reddit_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RiteAid\/comments\/nmxa89\/shorts_trapped_themselves\/","reddit_subreddit":"RiteAid","reddit_link_id":null,"reddit_parent_id":null,"reddit_submission":null},{"aware_post_type":"submission","aware_created_ts":"2021-05-28T08:11:07","reddit_id":"nmwh6d","reddit_name":"t3_nmwh6d","reddit_created_utc":1622203867,"reddit_author":"JazzPlayer77","reddit_text":"","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/RiteAid\/comments\/nmwh6d\/shorts_trapped_themselves\/","reddit_title":"Shorts Trapped Themselves","reddit_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/amcstock\/comments\/nmwgn8\/shorts_trapped_themselves\/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share","reddit_subreddit":"RiteAid","reddit_link_id":null,"reddit_parent_id":null,"reddit_submission":null},{"aware_post_type":"submission","aware_created_ts":"2021-05-13T22:15:00","reddit_id":"nbxxyj","reddit_name":"t3_nbxxyj","reddit_created_utc":1620958500,"reddit_author":"LandoPad","reddit_text":"I\u2019m a new employee at Rite aid and wasn\u2019t sure if there is a way to take unpaid time off.

Market share of these three pharmacies are: Rite Aid has 5% of the market, CVS 27%, Walgreens 22%. These numbers do not correlate to market cap differences! Now Rite Aid gets $40 for each Covid-19 Vaccination, a revenue source that was not in the picture last year. Also the revenues from the recently acquired Bartell Drugs (a family-owned **Seattle**\\-based drugstore chain of 67 **pharmacies)** was not in the picture last year.

Some forget that Rite Aid was a .25 cent stock in 2009 after an ill-timed acquisition of Eckerd\/Brooks in 2007.  Store execution issues long in effect only got worse picking up those 1800 stores with Corporate management doing more of-mismanaging.  So reputational harm took the stock down from $6.40 in 2007 (Eckerd Closing) to .25 cents in early 2009.  Then in 2018 the abandonment of the Albertsons merger with Rite Aid due to inadequate price and conflicts of interest once again caused reputational harm, and a .25 cent stock price (pre-reverse stock split) once again.  Wall St. certainly knows how to inflict punishment.  In both instances, it took several years for a recovery but now we have new senior management, not true before and a mostly new board of directors also not true before.  Covid shots and anticipated strong employment recovery, good for their pbm bodes well for the remainder of the year into next year at least.  Improvements in store customer service in comparison to CVS and Walgreens with more to come soon (it is on this year's Annual Meeting Agenda) also will help the bottom line.  Plus the stock is so undervalued based on what happened and the slow reputational recovery , once again, that even if The Feds end up raising interest rates later this year to slow down an overheated economic recovery, Rite Aid can still march to a different drummer-to continue to advance even in a bad stock market.  It is indeed a screaming BUY.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/RiteAid\/comments\/mj3c1k\/rite_aid_is_undervalued\/gtb64a3\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"RiteAid","reddit_link_id":"t3_mj3c1k","reddit_parent_id":"t3_mj3c1k","reddit_submission":"mj3c1k"},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2021-04-03T17:52:28","reddit_id":"gtacma8","reddit_name":"t1_gtacma8","reddit_created_utc":1617486748,"reddit_author":"Reindeer-Muted","reddit_text":"I've Been sayin this for a while.

All signs point to a major turn-around that started in 2019 with a new CEO. Every indicator shows an upward trend even before Covid. Rite Aid drifted from 1999 to 2019 with bad management, one officer even went to jail. Price was overly depressed and 8 to 14 million short shares constantly attacked. Only 55M shares due to reverse split in early 2019. In 2015 Walgreens made an offer for Rite Aid at $180 per share ($9 per share pre-split)  Rite Aid got out from excessive debt of $7B by selling Walgreens around 45% of stores and paying debt down to $3B after the buyout was called off. Since then sales are up, cash flow is up, lots of cap-ex keeping their 2400+ stores modern, in 2020 they bought a 96 store drug chain for cash. Also, they own a mid-sized PBM with double digit growth over past 2 years.  The PBM alone is worth more than Rite Aid's current market cap not even counting the 2400+ drug stores. If not a $180 share value then Rite Aid has a value of at least $90 and closed today up a point at $24.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/RiteAid\/comments\/m3j7fd\/lets_make_rad_stock_price_great_again\/gqrbads\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"RiteAid","reddit_link_id":"t3_m3j7fd","reddit_parent_id":"t3_m3j7fd","reddit_submission":"m3j7fd"},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2021-06-18T13:44:55","reddit_id":"h28f7ne","reddit_name":"t1_h28f7ne","reddit_created_utc":1624038295,"reddit_author":"kribz666","reddit_text":"Guys still up on this ?","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/RiteAid\/comments\/m3j7fd\/lets_make_rad_stock_price_great_again\/h28f7ne\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"RiteAid","reddit_link_id":"t3_m3j7fd","reddit_parent_id":"t3_m3j7fd","reddit_submission":"m3j7fd"},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2021-03-12T21:22:19","reddit_id":"gqrctpx","reddit_name":"t1_gqrctpx","reddit_created_utc":1615602139,"reddit_author":"JazzPlayer77","reddit_text":"Don't forget that they own Thrifty Ice Cream and it's sold in their stores.

They are way past that in a turn-around. New CEO, sales up, increasing cash flow, debt reduced, bought a 67 store drug chain in 2020 for cash, lots of cap-ex keeping stores modern and the hidden gem is their mid-sized PBM growing at double digits.  They bought the PBM years ago for $2B (more than than Rite Aid's current market cap) and could easily sell it for more than $3B today paying off all of Rite Aid's $3B debt. Company Sales today are 24B so the debt is reasonable. So selling the PBM would make Rite Aid a pure drug store play with no debt.

This is after a 1 for 20 reverse split that was done back in 2018. After the split. Shorts found themselves trapped in RAD.  Shorts have  since been losing hundreds of millions  from shorting RAD. Shorts have tried to cover to many times. With each attempt. RAD's shares would spike. Shorts would in return Short again, but Shorts can't cover and short more at the same time. Especially when RAD's price, as of late, has been rising in the opposite direction for shorts to profit. After GME showed the power of Retail buying against the Shorts. Shorts were clearly shaken. Shorts began to cover some, but just with what is now reported in RAD's short interest data. In order for Shorts to cover 7.3 million RAD shares. The cost is in the hundreds of millions. Shorts covering 7.3 M at $20 would cost Shorts $145 million. Now add  the price of $32 you get $233 million. At $40 it's $300 million. If you  follow the  pattern. You  can see what would happen at $80. Now for anyone who thinks these Shorts are not desperate and trapped. Then think again. If you pull up a 10 year chart. You will see a RAD price of over $200. Now that was all before RAD did their split. At that time RAD had a Billion shares outstanding. The predatory Shorts were pushing a Bankruptcy narrative for Rite Aid. At the Shorts highest percentage. Shorts were negative over 380 million shares. This is huge outlay cash. This is why I know it's Big Money and not Retail Shorts. RAD's latest earnings release is right around the corner. After December's earnings RAD traded as high as $32. This past Friday. RAD went as low $18.02 and afterward it bounced back on a Hammer Reversal. This fall squarely with the Fibonacci Sequence after RAD's 52 week high of $32. This is clearly a good opportunity.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/RiteAid\/comments\/lzkwa8\/rad_shorts_are_still_trapped\/","reddit_title":"RAD Shorts are Still Trapped","reddit_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RiteAid\/comments\/lzkwa8\/rad_shorts_are_still_trapped\/","reddit_subreddit":"RiteAid","reddit_link_id":null,"reddit_parent_id":null,"reddit_submission":null},{"aware_post_type":"submission","aware_created_ts":"2021-02-28T22:12:41","reddit_id":"luyi5v","reddit_name":"t3_luyi5v","reddit_created_utc":1614568361,"reddit_author":"5Sunshines","reddit_text":"Every vaccine appointment at Rite Aid within 50 miles of NYC is full.

So that\u2019s a total of $3,000 per store per week times 2,500 stores that\u2019s $7,500,000 a week times 6 months even though I think it will be all year That\u2019s $195,000,000 minus that off the $1,351,350,000 = $1,156,350,000 now let\u2019s say my costs are wrong or the revenue is only 5 days a week whatever you come up with poke holes please the fact is your talking close to 1 billion dollars a year in additional bottom line profit on a company that\u2019s market cap is only $1,400,000,000","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/RiteAid\/comments\/lif0mb\/rad_screaming_buy\/","reddit_title":"RAD Screaming Buy","reddit_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RiteAid\/comments\/lif0mb\/rad_screaming_buy\/","reddit_subreddit":"RiteAid","reddit_link_id":null,"reddit_parent_id":null,"reddit_submission":null},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2021-02-12T11:49:54","reddit_id":"gn2phz8","reddit_name":"t1_gn2phz8","reddit_created_utc":1613148594,"reddit_author":"Grammar-Bot-Elite","reddit_text":"\/u\/5Sunshines, I have found an error in your post:\n\n > \u201cneeded more ~~then~~ [**than**] ever\u201d\n\nYou, 5Sunshines, messed up a comment and can post \u201cneeded more ~~then~~ [**than**] ever\u201d instead.

We're charging forward on our journey to revitalize the chain drug store experience - store by store, community by community - and today we're ready and excited to invite customers to join us on this journey,\" said Jim Peters, chief operating officer, Rite Aid. \"Customers will soon take notice as the look and feel of our stores is being refreshed, our merchandising mix evolves to an assortment that best supports whole health, and perhaps most importantly, our trusted neighborhood pharmacists are empowered and qualified to consult not simply on traditional medicines, but alternative remedies as well. We're redefining an industry, and aspire to get each one of our customers to thrive.\"\n\n**Elevated Role of Pharmacists**\n\nRite Aid's 30-second television spot highlights the \"Perfect Fusion\" of traditional medicine and alternative remedies. At the center of this fusion are the company's more than 6,300 trusted neighborhood pharmacists. Rite Aid's RxEvolution is built around a firm belief that pharmacists can uniquely help consumers - and the regional health plans and the medical community that serve them - by more holistically and regularly engaging with them in between physician visits. \n\nThe new branding and ad campaign illustrate how Rite Aid pharmacists will elevate their role as whole health advocates within their communities, leveraging the high level of trust consumers already have in pharmacists and the frequency consumers access pharmacies during their everyday routines. Rite Aid also invested in continuing education to ensure that all Rite Aid pharmacists are not only certified immunizers, but now also trained integrative pharmacy specialists - so they are uniquely qualified and prepared to elevate the overall well-being of their customers and communities.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/RiteAid\/comments\/kgfjxu\/rite_aid_unveils_rebrand_and_vision_for_the\/gge9osm\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"RiteAid","reddit_link_id":"t3_kgfjxu","reddit_parent_id":"t3_kgfjxu","reddit_submission":"kgfjxu"},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2021-01-26T15:10:45","reddit_id":"gkv2j9s","reddit_name":"t1_gkv2j9s","reddit_created_utc":1611691845,"reddit_author":"Bob19116","reddit_text":"Rite Aid is my drugstore even though there are Walgreens and CVSs just as close.

I already had the coupon out and ready to use at check out. The cashier quickly looked at the coupon and said, \u201cI can\u2019t take this\u201d. Naturally, I asked why. She then proceeds to tell me that her \u201cmanager\u201d told her the coupon is not accepted. Ok, so who is your manager and I will need to speak to them. She then tells me that she\u2019s the manager. \ud83e\udd14 So, why did she refer the manager as a third person? I swear, I think she was making things up as she went along, I then asked her about this and she tells me it was her \u201cstore manager\u201d who wasn\u2019t there and she couldn\u2019t call. I couldn\u2019t believe what I was hearing. So, I started recording but as I started to record she walks away.\n\nAt this point,  1) she refused to tell me a valid reason why she couldn\u2019t accept my coupon. (Even though there\u2019s nothing in the coupon policy on their website to say otherwise) 2) she refused to get a manager or higher up 3) she refused to provide service by walking away. \n\nWhat\u2019s interesting is that this particular Rite Aid is located in a primarily black community and right after leaving this store I went to another Rite Aid in a community that is not primarily black and they accepted my coupon without any issues. \n\nSo, it\u2019s obvious that some ethical issues are going on in this particular store. I called the customer service number to complain but with Walgreens purchasing many Rite Aid stores, it\u2019s gone nowhere.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/RiteAid\/comments\/928w06\/discrimination_at_rite_aid\/","reddit_title":"Discrimination at Rite Aid","reddit_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RiteAid\/comments\/928w06\/discrimination_at_rite_aid\/","reddit_subreddit":"RiteAid","reddit_link_id":null,"reddit_parent_id":null,"reddit_submission":null},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2018-10-02T11:43:28","reddit_id":"e71848m","reddit_name":"t1_e71848m","reddit_created_utc":1538495008,"reddit_author":"gaypurple","reddit_text":"What does the black vs non black community have to do with it?

I was going through a tough time at that point; my girlfriend had just broken up with me, I dropped out of school, and my dog had just been diagnosed with heart lumps.  That being said, I was extremely vulnerable, and I fear that Rite-Aid may have taken advantage of me.  From the moment that I walked in, I was greeted by welcoming smells, smiling faces, and an overall warm environment, that kind of environment that I hadn't been immersed in for months at that point.  I spent six and a half hours in that Rite-Aid that day.  At first, I pretended to browse in the paper towel section, but I eventually moved onto the mascara section and read the label of every tube they had for sale.  The essence of this Rite-Aid, the glowing energy... it was like experiencing sex for the first time all over again.  Needless to say, I kept returning day after day, spending the entirety of my days browsing Rite-Aid and almost never buying anything.  I lost my job and I'd only go home to sleep, and when I did, I'd dream of Rite-Aid.  I finally began researching Rite-Aid and learning the company's history, finding that it was founded in 1962 and is based out of Scranton, Pennsylvania.  I learned everything that there is to know about Chairman and CEO John Standley, President and COO Ken Martindale, and CFO Frank Vitrano, and before long, began to see them as something more than mortal.  By early 2013, I had created a shrine made of empty Rite-Aid prescription bottles upholstered with Rite-Aid receipts adorned with the photos of these three men in the kitchen of my apartment.  I prayed every night at the base of this shrine, imploring Lord Standley to help me become one with Rite-Aid, to fuse my consciousness with the company that I so adored.  It was not until I lost my house and had my shrine destroyed by a CVS zealot that I began to doubt the omnipotence and benevolence of the Rite-Aid Holy Kings and reconsider my position on the matter.  At the same time, I still feel a deep, carnal attachment to Rite-Aid that I cannot seem to get over.  Can someone please either tell me that I'm being an idiot or confirm that there are others like me that see Rite-Aid as a modern Mecca?\n\nThanks","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/RiteAid\/comments\/25fcc2\/riteaid_worship\/","reddit_title":"Rite-Aid Worship","reddit_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RiteAid\/comments\/25fcc2\/riteaid_worship\/","reddit_subreddit":"RiteAid","reddit_link_id":null,"reddit_parent_id":null,"reddit_submission":null},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2014-08-25T05:40:09","reddit_id":"cjzu5xd","reddit_name":"t1_cjzu5xd","reddit_created_utc":1408959609,"reddit_author":"Allister24","reddit_text":"As a rite aid employee, I agree","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/RiteAid\/comments\/25fcc2\/riteaid_worship\/cjzu5xd\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"RiteAid","reddit_link_id":"t3_25fcc2","reddit_parent_id":"t3_25fcc2","reddit_submission":"25fcc2"},{"aware_post_type":"submission","aware_created_ts":"2023-04-12T20:05:32","reddit_id":"12k4u9f","reddit_name":"t3_12k4u9f","reddit_created_utc":1681344332,"reddit_author":"Fearless_Resolve8975","reddit_text":"Gonna be a new shift supervisor in a week or so, never worked at rite aid before.

Also, you can throw out probably 99% of the GNC Spinner Rack shelf labels: they send far too many and they\u2019re too large for the rack. You only need four MAX for it, not the fifty six that they send every time the GNC stuff is on sale. Walking your endcaps and floor displays specifically into your store layout walk makes signing those easier when they hit Vestcom and get printed in order. Leaving them for the end takes forever and adds unnecessary walking. We used to spend Saturday morning taking the old ad pricing down, and the closers would put the new signage up. Trust me, it DOESN\u2019T MATTER because business drops off after the Pharmacy closes at 6.

I was hired as a cashier, and as I\u2019m posting this that\u2019s still my job title. About two months into working at my store I was offered a supervisor position, but it was then told that I had to be 21 in order to be a supervisor (I\u2019m only 20). this was back last year when we had a different store manager and different assistant store manager than we do now.\n\nIn February we finally got our two new managers, and they were all on board with making me a supervisor when I turn 21, but once they got to know me and started working with me more they had told me that they liked the idea of me becoming an ASM better. So, they basically been getting me prepped and training me and all that fun stuff in the meantime while we wait for me to turn 21 (which will be May 24th). Today my store manager gave me the candidate assessment an interview guide for assistant store managers to look over.

My insurance wouldn\u2019t cover it, but I had the option to change insurance plans during open enrollment to one that would, so I decided to try the first 2 months dose-age out of pocket to see if it was worth doing (yes, I know it was a lot but it was almost exactly what I got back in taxes and it would be a huge hassle to change insurance plans so I did it anyways). \n\nAfter the first month (which went ok - lost a few lbs in the first week or so but not a whole lot after that) I went to the pharmacy to pick up my second dose (each dose was $1400 so it was a lot) and they gave me the same dosage as the first months (.25mg) when it was supposed to increase from .25mg to .50 mg. \n\nI noticed that before taking it the next morning and called to ask them to exchange it and they said flat out \u2018no.\u2019 They said right or wrong, once it\u2019s left the pharmacy there is no way we\u2019re ever exchanging it or giving you your money back. After that, they put me on hold to  check the original prescription and came back saying it was originally written for 2 months at .25  so they had zero responsibility for it because it was dispensed as written to begin w. They said the only thing you could do is get your doctor to call in the .50mg and pay full price for it (another $1400) if you want to get it, but there\u2019s absolutely no chance your getting the right dosage from us w\/o paying again for it. \n\nNow, this is where it get crazy tho. I called AHEAD OF TIME (before they filled it) and asked them to confirm that second months dosage was right before ordering it and they said \u2018yes, the second dose will be .5 rather than .25\u2019 and confirmed it (why? Because it\u2019s a super expensive drug and wanted to make sure everything was right before I made a huge investment like that). I mean regardless of whether the Dr messed up or not, I had even called myself as a consumer to make sure they ordered the right thing (which I don\u2019t think I should have to do) and they still messed it up. On top of that, they then refused to even acknowledge that and said I was making things up because there was no way someone from their pharmacy would\u2019ve said that and filled it wrong then still said \u2018not our problem, goodbye.\u2019 \n\nAs a follow-up, I called my doctor (he wasn\u2019t in for the day) and got thru to their manager who called back later. What they said was this: regardless of what the prescription was written for (2 months at .25mg or not) it\u2019s the pharmacist responsibility to check it and make sure it\u2019s right or call them to make sure it\u2019s being dispensed right because it is a titrated medication that\u2019s clearly supposed to be dispensed at different levels each month. I don\u2019t know how true that is or what weight it holds in arguing w them, but I felt the same way considering I had called ahead and made sure that was the case ahead of time myself. Since the Dr wasn\u2019t in tho, I was told I\u2019d have to wait to the next day to hear his thoughts and called the manufacturer in the meantime.\n\nLong story short, I called the manufacturer of yesterday and said that they felt as though the pharmacy was wrong. They said regardless of how the prescription was written, they know this is a titrated medication that should be stepped up after the first month, and if they didn\u2019t consult with you or your doctor before distributing you the same dose the second month first, then that\u2019s their responsibility. As a pharmacist they should know that. Honestly, whether that\u2019s true or not, I know I called the pharmacy MYSELF ahead of time and was told it would be increased properly, so I feel extra strongly that that\u2019s the case.\n\nWhere I\u2019m at now though, everyone\u2019s standing around (Dr, pharmacy, manufacturer) saying \u2018yeah, everyone messed up majorly but there\u2019s nothing we can do and your just stuck w a $1400 bill for something that\u2019s worthless to you because no one\u2019s taking responsibility.\u2019 What the hell? Everyone else made the mistake it seems and they\u2019re just saying \u2018tough luck\u2019 (everyone except the manufacturer at least who\u2019s saying don\u2019t give into the pharmacy b\/c their at fault and trying to avoid responsibility and to do that means making you rollover and eat it). This could\u2019ve been used for a downpayment a car, to pay down my student loans - so many things that I had a use for this on and it\u2019s just gone w a big \u2018f you, we don\u2019t care.\u2019\n\nWhat should I do?\n\nTLDR: Pharmacy dispensed an expensive drug ($1400 a month out of pocket) to me in the wrong the dose and now says that they won\u2019t exchange it or return for cash value because it\u2019s left the pharmacy. What recourse do I have? Is there any way I can talk to someone up the ladder at Rite Aid that will help? Should I get a lawyer? If so, who should I talk to and what should I be looking for? Any terminology I can use with anyone help get something back at all? I feel like I really got screwed here and no-one at the pharmacy seems to care at all.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/RiteAid\/comments\/13la1n1\/local_riteaid_gave_me_the_wrong_dose_of_meds_that\/","reddit_title":"Local RiteAid gave me the wrong dose of Meds that were $1400 out of pocket for and won\u2019t fix it.

Fingers can be pointed to every party:\n\nYour doctor knows that none of the 3 largest chain pharmacies will take an electronic multi-drug prescription. So if your doctor wrote for the 0.25, the pharmacies obligations by Federal and generally state law are to give you what the doctor ordered. NOT what the doctor fills in as a note for the script. Because even if it says to move up to 0.5mg after a month, there is not a valid prescription on file because your doctor did not send it right. Your doctor didnt follow through. \n\nThe pharmacy worker who said you would be fine was wrong, but the pharmacist and pharmacy weren't. The individual you were talking to did not know the actual answer, which is typical in pharmacy. The tech COULD have read the script and interpreted it to mean the Doc would be sending in a followup script. They instead incorrectly said the script on file would also work as the next dose, which only someone who understands pharmacy law and regulations would know wasnt true. This shows the disconnect between pharmacists and their patients and the lack of training most pharmacy workers have.\n\nYour insurance has zero fault actually. People are on the same dose for months, regularly. Its not unheard of for a doctor to make mention of the higher dose and send the script exactly 4 weeks later. Its actually the best way for all parties. \n\nYou have an obligation to know what you are picking up and signing for. Similar to reading the terms and conditions of just about anything in life now, if you sign and agree, its done, you cant pleas ignorance if something goes wrong. There are no take-backsies when it comes to those sorts of agreements and many patients have not been educated on these things like they should have. \n\nSo even though it could be called multiple peoples faults, its everyone (other than the corporations) who suffers here. You were likely annoyed with the pharmacy workers, and potentially gave them slack. Completely understandable!! But now that workers day may be ruined for a mistake or policy that stops them from resolving your issue. A mistake that wouldnt have been made if they were trained properly. And the only ones who win are the corporations. So being an educated consumer is the best way you can avoid these corporate pitfalls and personal financial setbacks. \n\nThe first person you should be mad at, though, is your doctors office. If they sent the scripts in correctly in the first place, no other party would have had an issue.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/RiteAid\/comments\/13la1n1\/local_riteaid_gave_me_the_wrong_dose_of_meds_that\/jkq09oi\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"RiteAid","reddit_link_id":"t3_13la1n1","reddit_parent_id":"t3_13la1n1","reddit_submission":"13la1n1"},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2023-05-18T22:33:03","reddit_id":"jkpzrxv","reddit_name":"t1_jkpzrxv","reddit_created_utc":1684463583,"reddit_author":"Squemishsquash","reddit_text":"So i worked in a rite aid for a bit, not the pharmacy end but i did sit through the cbts regarding pharmaceuticals that i had to watch and i did ring up some medications.

Still doing PTU to get certified and ofc still learning because no one had time to set aside and actually train me at my store since we are so busy. I was lucky enough to come from a job background that held a lot of similarities so thankfully everything is going smoothly. \n\nHowever, in that time I've noticed that most all the other techs want to do is filling and nothing else. They let data entry go into triple digits despite filling being hours ahead with three techs working at once. They'll never put up the order unless myself or another tech isn't there to take care of it. And most importantly they act like the customers coming to grab their prescriptions is the biggest inconvenience they could ever get. Including the one girl we have who is just a cashier specifically for pharmacy.\n\nLike is it just a thing for most of the techs to push everything no computer related on to the newbie? It's to the point that I get nearly no production experience. Another tech who's only peen there maybe a month longer than me even pushed me off my station one day, even though the pharmacist told me he wanted me to focus on filling that day. I ended up having to juggle most of the customers like usual. And I'm often the one putting up the order\/center fill, which most days I don't mind unless the others decide it isn't a day where they want to engage with the public, and  constantly call me to the register to ring people out. And on days where they have to help me with line managment they get snippy and slow down to only take care of one person while I check out the next seven in house and bounce to the drive thru. \n\nI've been told no less than 5 times in the last two weeks that I was the nicest tech back there by customers. Honestly thought people were just being nice because the pharmacists have such nice relations with the clients. But then one lady had me grab the head pharmacist so she could give a formal complaint about the girl who'd helped her like a month prior all while singing my praises. \n\nMaybe it's my customer service background but most clients I've dealt with  never envoke the level of hostility and attitude these techs throw at them. It'd surprise me that they still have jobs if I didn't already know how desperate the pharmacy was for workers. \n\nThe techs have done everything from rudely ask the customers what they needed, to rushing past me cursing about how they had to help two customers and it was \"just fing ridiculous\", and eating in front of the customers talking to them with their mouth full and then continuing to eat while helping them. My favorite has definitely been the pettiness of them staring me down from the register when there are only three people in line and I'm switched over to PTU by order of head pharmacist.\n\nI've only worked at this one location but is this like the standard attitude for most techs with this company?","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/RiteAid\/comments\/13pbfsx\/are_unhelpful_borderline_rude_techs_just_standard\/","reddit_title":"Are unhelpful borderline rude techs just standard?","reddit_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RiteAid\/comments\/13pbfsx\/are_unhelpful_borderline_rude_techs_just_standard\/","reddit_subreddit":"RiteAid","reddit_link_id":null,"reddit_parent_id":null,"reddit_submission":null},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2023-05-23T00:15:12","reddit_id":"jl91fa9","reddit_name":"t1_jl91fa9","reddit_created_utc":1684815312,"reddit_author":"HintOfDisney","reddit_text":"Honestly it's all store specific.

I would wear business casual attire. Nothing super fancy or flashy as it is a retail job, but definitely dress professionally. It will depend on the person interviewing you, but if they are following an interview guide you can expect behavioral based questions following the STAR interviewing method--situation, task, action, result. Definitely have some stories in mind for things like times you dealt with a difficult customer\/employee\/manager, how you have improved processes, how you have successfully led teams and produced results. The interviewer will like to hear that you have open availability and are willing to work odd hours including holidays, evenings, weekends, potentially nights from time to time.\n\nI'd also suggest that you arrive early to walk around the store and get a feel for it (assuming you are being interviewed in a store) and interact with any associate who greets you.

I would just like the money I'm due if possible because it's not fair that i worked through the entire pandemic and won't get anything just because I don't work for Rite Aid any longer.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/RiteAid\/comments\/147b22t\/nys_essential_workers_bonus\/","reddit_title":"NYS Essential workers bonus","reddit_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RiteAid\/comments\/147b22t\/nys_essential_workers_bonus\/","reddit_subreddit":"RiteAid","reddit_link_id":null,"reddit_parent_id":null,"reddit_submission":null},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2023-06-11T21:56:05","reddit_id":"jnuqibe","reddit_name":"t1_jnuqibe","reddit_created_utc":1686534965,"reddit_author":"Deacon_Blues1","reddit_text":"They did you dirty, you won\u2019t see a dime and I\u2019m sorry for that.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/RiteAid\/comments\/147b22t\/nys_essential_workers_bonus\/jnuqibe\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"RiteAid","reddit_link_id":"t3_147b22t","reddit_parent_id":"t3_147b22t","reddit_submission":"147b22t"},{"aware_post_type":"submission","aware_created_ts":"2023-06-13T01:26:58","reddit_id":"1487dwn","reddit_name":"t3_1487dwn","reddit_created_utc":1686634018,"reddit_author":"yeetumskeetumm","reddit_text":"Is there a way to see my schedule online?","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/RiteAid\/comments\/1487dwn\/schedule_online\/","reddit_title":"Schedule online?","reddit_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RiteAid\/comments\/1487dwn\/schedule_online\/","reddit_subreddit":"RiteAid","reddit_link_id":null,"reddit_parent_id":null,"reddit_submission":null},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2023-06-13T06:25:47","reddit_id":"jnzb7de","reddit_name":"t1_jnzb7de","reddit_created_utc":1686651947,"reddit_author":"CPhlegmChunk","reddit_text":"Nope.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/RiteAid\/comments\/1487dwn\/schedule_online\/jnzb7de\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"RiteAid","reddit_link_id":"t3_1487dwn","reddit_parent_id":"t3_1487dwn","reddit_submission":"1487dwn"},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2023-06-13T09:33:57","reddit_id":"jnzqf9c","reddit_name":"t1_jnzqf9c","reddit_created_utc":1686663237,"reddit_author":"Fine_Duck4471","reddit_text":"Not right now, but by the end of the month you'll be able to.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/RiteAid\/comments\/1487dwn\/schedule_online\/jnzqf9c\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"RiteAid","reddit_link_id":"t3_1487dwn","reddit_parent_id":"t3_1487dwn","reddit_submission":"1487dwn"},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2023-06-13T09:37:29","reddit_id":"jnzqrxx","reddit_name":"t1_jnzqrxx","reddit_created_utc":1686663449,"reddit_author":"CPhlegmChunk","reddit_text":"I\u2019ll believe that when I see it.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/RiteAid\/comments\/1487dwn\/schedule_online\/jnzqrxx\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"RiteAid","reddit_link_id":"t3_1487dwn","reddit_parent_id":"t1_jnzqf9c","reddit_submission":"1487dwn"},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2023-06-13T12:28:04","reddit_id":"jo09y11","reddit_name":"t1_jo09y11","reddit_created_utc":1686673684,"reddit_author":"InternetNo5259","reddit_text":"The number of new executives, programs and procedures is exhausting.

I know my local store is short staffed and has had fliers up that they\u2019re looking for people for months now, wondering if that\u2019s the case. Should I be concerned they may close soon if they don\u2019t have the resources to fill meds themselves, or could this be so that my insurance covers the meds? I ended up switching to this pharmacy because another pharmacy started getting a manufacturer my insurance wouldn\u2019t cover, and didn\u2019t offer to get a different pharmacy to send in or anything for me and just wanted to charge me instead lol. I\u2019m wondering of either of those may be the case, just genuinely curious.\n\nThanks!","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/RiteAid\/comments\/1597hxr\/why_do_different_pharmacies_always_fill_my\/","reddit_title":"Why do different pharmacies always fill my scripts and send them over?","reddit_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RiteAid\/comments\/1597hxr\/why_do_different_pharmacies_always_fill_my\/","reddit_subreddit":"RiteAid","reddit_link_id":null,"reddit_parent_id":null,"reddit_submission":null},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2023-07-25T09:02:09","reddit_id":"jtdnwuc","reddit_name":"t1_jtdnwuc","reddit_created_utc":1690290129,"reddit_author":"lionheart4life","reddit_text":"The other pharmacy does a part of the prescription, like entering it or reviewing it, then your local one finishes it up.

It is rare that this happens, but it is possible.\n \nSecond, if Rite Aid as is sold as an entity, the acquiring company typically assumes all existing contracts that have not been canceled in bankruptcy -- including collective bargaining agreements. This is common in many non-bankruptcy mergers and acquisitions. \n \nHowever, there is a third case. Based on what I'm following, it sounds likely that Rite Aid the company won't be sold. Instead, it sounds like buyers are interested in an asset sale. In this case, the buyers are not purchasing the company and its contracts (including employment contracts). They are simply buying pieces of the company that the court is allowing to be sold -- leases, real estate, inventory, etc. All the pieces are sold off until there is nothing left of Rite Aid. If this is what happens, you will no longer be employed by Rite Aid and your contract will end. If your store is sold in an asset sale, you will need to be offered new employment with the buyer.

Then I got the drug test request, and didn't hear from ANYONE for 2 weeks after that. Then, I got an email prompting me to create a portal account via Workday\/rite aid. Then nothing. A week later I got ANOTHER email asking me to do the same thing, which I had done. Then I got a call from Rite Aid tech support telling me that I had forms to fill out that were sent through my portal. That was a lie. I had NOTHING showing up on my portal. So I was urged to call tech support 1, who could not figure out why nothing wasn't showing up. I tried to send her a screenshot of my portal page, but I guess Rite Aid blocks all outside emails. She told me to call another tech support number, who were so confused about what was happening, and kept asking me what my employee ID was. No, I don't have that yet. When they finally SORT OF understood the issue, they said they would send another link. Omg. So I called the first tech support woman back, and she made a note that I was having trouble accessing forms. She instructed me to call my manager who hired me, and that he should let his district supervisor know. It took 3 days to get a new link, which didn't work. So I called tech support AGAIN, who told me they would send another link. The district manager got to it first, and somehow, I was able to access my portal and sign the forms. BUT, this weekend, ANOTHER WEEK AFTER I GOT MY PORTAL WORKING, I was INUNDATED with a bunch of tasks and forms through my email. But, when clicking on ANY OF THEM, it sends me to a page asking to sign into Microsoft. Ok? I tried my ONLY Microsoft email, which is the same email I have been using for Rite Aid AND the ONLY email I have ever used for Microsoft. Nope! Error! So it says my email isn't recognized at all. Upon doing some research, the way to fix this is to fill out a recovery form to Microsoft that HOPEFULLY will allow me to access those forms. I DOUBT IT.
