In unison, they reach out their arms for their mommy. \n\nHungry appendages ooze out of their master\u2019s gooey creases.

The Mother eagerly reaches down their throats, slithering through their digestive tracts and firmly grasping their innards. The servants\u2019 bodies relax as her juices pulsate through them and willingly, lovingly, worshipfully, they give up control of their minds, their hearts, and their very souls.\n\nEventually morning comes. Panera cafes opens at 6:00 AM. An hour before the breakfast rush starts, Mother Bread viciously slaps each servant, tickling them until they awake. Slowly, they regain consciousness. They exit Mother\u2019s home, eager to start another day of harassing bakers for the dumbest shit.

It fucking sucked. I told them I wanted to be a cashier, but because I was over 18, they made me the prep cook because I'd be able to go into the freezer. I fell into their trap. I had to start my shift at 5 am when I said I was not willing to start any earlier than 8. They loopholed me out of breaks because I \"have to get the list done.\" Every other person in my store who had prepped agreed that it was impossible to finish the list in a six-hour shift. Hell, even an 8-hour shift. Supervisors got on my case for staying on the clock too long but it was only because I was trying to finish as much as I can. I stayed at least an hour later for most of my shifts.\n\nMy orientation was online for COVID even though nobody was social distancing anymore. I was supposed to have three days of training but really only got two because of short staffing. I was left unprepared and felt unsafe. I was wielding a giant knife and cut gloves were often lost or in the wrong place to I have to suck it up and cut. I got small cuts on two of my fingers from trying to clean the produce slicer.  I got hurt trying to get through the walk-in because on truck days there were always boxes stacked higher than me and I had to climb around them to just get to things I needed for the list. I stained my clothes because the store ran out of aprons.\n\nThis job ate me alive. Every day I came home tired and miserable going straight to bed. All for $10 an hour.

I'd rather not leave yet if I don't have to, especially because I went through some family bs last year where my grandparents, who I was stuck living with at the time, would never shut the fuck up so I could sleep before work and also decided they didn't have to respect any sort of boundaries. So that affected my mental health badly enough that I was fired from two jobs within a short period of time, and leaving a third after only a few months on top of having a gap on my resume that I can't be honest about would just look really bad for future positions. \n\nBut I live in a high cost of living area, and while I technically could support myself on a cashier's pay money would always be tight, I'd have to leave my dog behind, and I'd be pretty fucked if I had any kind of financial emergency. Then I heard that night shift pays way more, and I like the idea of doing that. I've struggled with night shift positions before, but being away from a toxic situation should help, and I'd finally be able to get my own place and take my dog with me. Ideally I would want my schedule to consistently be 5 pm Monday-10 am Tuesday and 5pm Thursday-10 am Friday each with a break, plus 12:30 am-9 am Wednesday with a break.

Closings are much easier to get as it usually teenagers (high school age and college students returning) who work closings and in turn have less rigid schedules and there is more variation. If you want to work mornings\/mid shifts be prepared to be work less hours as, as previously stated, the morning workers tend to have more rigid schedules. \n- The culture vastly depends on who you work with. With older associates it tends to be more get the work done and go home while with younger coworkers there is a more social aspect (tends to be more cliquey) but if you\u2019re social you won\u2019t have a problem fitting into those. However, if you\u2019re more quiet it may be hard at first to make \u201cfriends\u201d at work (this may not matter to you but it can help when you need shifts covered and helps the shift to go faster IMO) \n- Managment tends to vary from managers who are scatter brained and don\u2019t really care to managers who genuinely care about their associates and their needs. You\u2019ll have a GM, and usually 1-3 AGM\u2019s as well as shift supervisors depending on the cafe. Your interview will be done by either a GM or the hiring manager (usually an AGM to my knowledge). In terms of treatment by managers: Currently, my scheduling manager is fantastic and makes sure he listens to our availability and needs (who we don\u2019t feel comfortable working with, etc.) but I have also had managers schedule me on days I requested off 5 months in advance for so there is a lot of variation.\n- I never had an official interview as I was hired because they liked my sister a lot lol but from what I have heard you\u2019re questioned about your availability, prior experience (specifically in food service), as well as if you\u2019re seasonal, part time, or full time. - In terms of seasonal, you may be at a disadvantage because many Panera\u2019s get screwed over once the seasonal (usually college kids) go back to school so many cafes have held off on hiring them for that reason. \n\nI hope this helps! \nLet me know if you have any other questions and I can try to answer them.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/PaneraEmployees\/comments\/wgi69b\/what_is_the_job_like\/ij0h7k1\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"PaneraEmployees","reddit_link_id":"t3_wgi69b","reddit_parent_id":"t3_wgi69b","reddit_submission":"wgi69b"},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2022-08-05T18:44:17","reddit_id":"ij46rt1","reddit_name":"t1_ij46rt1","reddit_created_utc":1659739457,"reddit_author":"PeeB4uGoToBed","reddit_text":"Depends on if it's franchised or corporate and if franchised, who owns it?

Once we switch over to day baking I'm quitting.

As a minor, during the school year, I was always kept way longer than I was supposed to and often times made to clean and stock a lot of things. Some examples include being expected to close cash, clean the barista station, clean the bread wall, clean the pastry counter, clean the bathroom and the dining room. There are other things I had to do too and it was super stressful because my manager knew I had to go home, do homework and still show up to school the next day. Besides that, he was also very rude when it came to me asking for time for school stuff. I played volleyball and had games some evenings and he'd always complain when I asked for time, which wasn't even very frequent. \n\nNot only was the manager the problem, the customers made me very uncomfortable on several occasions. Once, a woman bombarded me with questions about pricing and was getting upset with me over the prices. I suffer from anxiety and her boarding me with questions was triggering it. I also had a full screen on drinks to make so I just called my manger and a coworker took me to the freezer when they noticed me getting anxious. \n\nAnother time, a man came in two days in a row with his family. The first time he was very annoyed with me because I was still new and didn't know how to add bacon to his bagel. I had to ask a coworker and that just made him more annoyed. The next day, he was made because he ordered from the kiosk and asked me for the drinks and I didn't know what he had ordered. I asked for his receipt and he refused to let me see it so I had to take a guess on which order on the screen was his. \n\na few other cases that were super disturbing were when one man asked me for naked pictures of my manager and a grown man refused to give me his Panera number because he kept saying 'he was married'. \n\nAnother things that annoyed me were that no one every wanted to clean properly so I had to do it and when I finished cleaning, my manager would check over everything things and tell me I didn't clean something good enough or something like that.\n\nCoworkers often got annoyed with me because I asked for help with the bread slicer when I was not of age to touch it. My manager was always on me about asking for help but did not care when he saw my co workers feeling annoyed. \n\nI hated this job and had to quit.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/PaneraEmployees\/comments\/vtud2k\/please_tell_me_about_your_experiences\/","reddit_title":"please tell me about your experiences please...everyone in my family thinks I'm exaggerating and its so annoying","reddit_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/PaneraEmployees\/comments\/vtud2k\/please_tell_me_about_your_experiences\/","reddit_subreddit":"PaneraEmployees","reddit_link_id":null,"reddit_parent_id":null,"reddit_submission":null},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2022-07-07T18:29:35","reddit_id":"if9n2wk","reddit_name":"t1_if9n2wk","reddit_created_utc":1657232975,"reddit_author":"DogTheBreadFairy","reddit_text":"That all seems pretty normal I think maybe you are exaggerating a little because it was your first experience working a job \n\nBut all the tasks you listed are normal closing tasks for you to have done\n\nAnd that's really just what working with the public is like...

I have not only been treated horrible but with no respect. \n\nToday I was suppose to work from 10-3. During the whole shift I was told to do over 10 things while the everyone else just stood around on their phones and talked. This didn\u2019t stop the manager from not caring one bit. When the second manger of the day arrived he allowed 2 people to leave way before there time. When I told him I leave at 3 he just gave a list of orders to be done. It hard to get it done because whenever something needed to be done I was the one they called. Finally when 3 arrived I clocked out and told everyone bye. The manager then proceeded to tell me that no one said I can leave and I have no right to clock out before my replacement comes. My replacement didn\u2019t come till 4 and I had a meeting at 4 so I had to get home in order to prepare. He caught a horrible attitude and just went off. Afterwards he told me to just leave. I was confused because he left everyone else leave without a word about a replacement. Even left 2 people go home early. \n\nThis was not the first time I have been treated this way. A couple weeks ago I was working morning shift and a customer wasted food on the floor. I had a line of people waiting to order, manager yelling at me because we are out of some stuff at the drink bar and that the lobby needs to be clean. No one else was doing expect chilling on their phones. When I finally got a minute to go into the lobby and clean and stock the drink bar with lids and straws. I finished cleaning and ran to bathroom because I had no break the whole time. When I got back only 2 people were at the front. She yells at me that I need to stop waking away and how sick and tired she of telling me that. \n\nThose are not things that have happened. When I am suppose to work the drive thru I am expected to do everything there and also help whoever is up front. No one ever helps me up front and I stay till almost 10:30-45 closing by myself. When I ask the manager for help they just tell me to get better time management skills. I am expected to go out of my way to help everyone when no one ever helps me not even the manger sometimes. I have been left to take orders and fix the food.  \n\nI have no idea what to do about this anymore.

I have worked in every store in my state at least once. My travel radius covers 4 states and 3 markets. Recently while i was training someone our Bakery Market Manager showed up. She bragged to the trainee about how she doesn\u2019t actually bake in the cafes before she went around rudely critiquing the sweets the newbie made. This was only their 3rd day working btw. \nShe often pulled me away from the trainee from the trainee and tried to talk to me for the whole 3 hours she was there. Most of it wasn\u2019t even work related, except for the part where she reminded me to work \u201chip to hip\u201d with the trainee as much as possible. \n\nSo not only did this person come in, brag to a new hire about how she is one of the only BMMs that doesn\u2019t bake,  she also simultaneously managed to tell me how to do a job she had never done while preventing me from following those instructions. While thats kind of cynically impressive, it brings me to my main question. \n\nDoes any one else have BMMs that don\u2019t bake?\n \nI mean for real, she has maybe baked 3 times in the last year. And it was an absolute emergency. When she does bake she has day shift do the cookies and bagels for her and she doesnt make souflees, clean, or pan anything up for the next day. \n\nWhen a store is over loaded with a big bake, rather than going to help with the bake she has traveling bakers or the BTS work in two stores (sometimes solo).\n\nIm going to HR about this soon but i just wanted to know, is she the only BMM that doesnt ever help with baking in cafes?\n\nAs a final note, I was scheduled to have surgery at the end of the month, i was still in a lot of pain but i would drive the 80-120 miles to work, and complete my bake every day. I finally was in so much pain i called to ask for help. She told me the help would come but it never did. I had to call off the next night but i let her know on my way home. She told me she would see what she could do but she was not, \u201cphysically capable of doing a whole bake by herself.\u201d We were understaffed bc of a covid exposure in another market that took out 4 bakers between two stores. So how did that even happen ? \n\nRather than working one night solo doing a very small easy bake and freeing up a baker she stayed home. She asked  a baker to go help another cafe with a massive catering order that needed to be ready before the store opened. The other baker finished their shift and went to the other cafe which was staffed by a trainer and trainee. They got the bake done but found out that night that the baker who worked their the night prior tested positive for covid later that day and had unknowingly exposed their coworkers and by extension the traveling baker who went to help.\n\nShe went on to pressure sick staff to come back to work while they were still sympathetic and testing positive. All this just bc she doesn\u2019t bake.\n\n\nIm looking for answers and suggestions. Please this cant be normal right?\nWhat do we do?","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/PaneraEmployees\/comments\/t6hkew\/bmm_doesnt_bake_in_cafes\/","reddit_title":"BMM \u201cdoesn\u2019t bake in cafes\u201d","reddit_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/PaneraEmployees\/comments\/t6hkew\/bmm_doesnt_bake_in_cafes\/","reddit_subreddit":"PaneraEmployees","reddit_link_id":null,"reddit_parent_id":null,"reddit_submission":null},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2022-03-08T09:17:57","reddit_id":"hzu7vza","reddit_name":"t1_hzu7vza","reddit_created_utc":1646749077,"reddit_author":"pfftiful","reddit_text":"Typically, BMMs don't bake.

I've been a BTS for just under a year, and I am just now getting to a point where I'm not baking every single one of my shifts.

My manager loved pleasing and kissing ass to customers. Let\u2019s talk about my personality I\u2019m very nonchalant I don\u2019t really express my emotions as much as others do. I\u2019ve been trying to be a little bit more personable. Most of the time I will be by myself on the cash register and when the lines get long it overwhelms me. So I try to move as quickly as possible. Which I guess bothers some customers. Recently this Anonymous customer made an anonymous review through some Panera reviews thing. The customer complained that it seemed like I wanted them to be gone fast. Idk what that even means, I tend to ring up peoples order very fast because the menu is so basic. A lot of customers expect you to be high energy all day, like I\u2019m a human too. Of course my manager found out and looked at the cameras (because he\u2019s always watching us for some reason) and he was saying that your not going to be here very long. Mind you this was the second time he has threatened to fire me. This isn\u2019t the first customer report about me. Overall our store has the worst reputation, worst performance, and overall worst customer satisfaction. People complain about such little things that we can\u2019t control. He does a lot of shady things like we don\u2019t get breaks sometimes he\u2019ll have minors work 12hr shifts. He says he schedules people based on performance, which I think is dumb for a minimum wage job. My co workers have told me that I should leave that they (management) don\u2019t treat me right, that if they were me they would have left a long time ago. I just really want to report my manager to corporate. I like my coworkers it\u2019s just the management is trash and money hungry. We opened during a blizzard when every other place was closed barely any customers coming in. I normally work 2 days a week (I\u2019ve been trying to get more days than that, but I gave and got a second job). For the past couple of months my manager has not been giving me a lot of hours and also back in December there\u2019s a time when I have my availability open from sunrise to sundown and not once did he put me on the schedule to work. I did not get a paycheck for almost a month. Now I\u2019m choosing to work one day a week in adjunct to my second job, because Panera is such a stressful job. What should I do? Any advice? Opinions? Reactions?

I want my store and my fellow employees to succeed and grow as people. \n\nSo my question is, what are some of the biggest issues you have had with managers, past or present, especially at Panera. What did they do? What did you do? What would you have liked for them to do differently? Did you quit because of it?\n\nFeel free to share other negative experiences with other staff members and how you wish management would have handled it.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/PaneraEmployees\/comments\/rxwafp\/im_a_new_assistant_manager\/","reddit_title":"I'm a new Assistant Manager.","reddit_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/PaneraEmployees\/comments\/rxwafp\/im_a_new_assistant_manager\/","reddit_subreddit":"PaneraEmployees","reddit_link_id":null,"reddit_parent_id":null,"reddit_submission":null},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2022-01-13T22:48:21","reddit_id":"hsl0e16","reddit_name":"t1_hsl0e16","reddit_created_utc":1642132101,"reddit_author":"SkylarAnthony","reddit_text":"Hi!\n\nI am a manager in training at Panera and have worked here for a year. Starting out at Panera is confusing! Sometimes it feels like your trainers and managers are you life boats! Consistently checking in with new hires really helps them feel comfortable and stay through the good days and tough ones. I know the reason I continue to work at Panera is because we all look out for each other, jump in and help, and I think customers definitely can tell we are happy because of the quality of our service. \n\nThat being said, here are a few things I think help!\n\n1. Simplify!!! Break down everything into 2 or 3 steps for training. For example: opening bakery? Set up display and slice breads are the main goals. Closing? Get everything back and organize\/ clean. This make communication easy and effective. So people know what\u2019s expected of them.\n\n2. Recognize actions! If someone gets something done, thank them! It really keeps motivation going when people are recognized, even for small things.\n\n3. Dedicate people to sections! Everyone should have their specific role so they travel less and are more efficient! \n\n4. If something goes wrong with a customer:\nApologize, explain (briefly), and assure that they will get their product.\n\n\nThings specific to Panera:\n- we run out of everything all the time! \n- older demographic (there will be complaints about price and what not)\n- People like their coffee! Try to brew it before it\u2019s needed or dedicate someone to check up on it every half an hour or so!\n- Our database often is wacky, things that are stocked out with often be ordered through door dash, be prepared to offer people replacements and cookies!\n- Get breads sliced early! Try to get the opener to slice them all!\n\nThat\u2019s all I can think of for now, I\u2019m glad you have a passion for people and running a business! I wish you luck at your new job!","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/PaneraEmployees\/comments\/rxwafp\/im_a_new_assistant_manager\/hsl0e16\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"PaneraEmployees","reddit_link_id":"t3_rxwafp","reddit_parent_id":"t3_rxwafp","reddit_submission":"rxwafp"},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2022-01-14T11:24:40","reddit_id":"hsn8leg","reddit_name":"t1_hsn8leg","reddit_created_utc":1642177480,"reddit_author":"HeiseNeko","reddit_text":"harassment:\npast managers were great about stopping harassment from employees and other managers, but sucked at stopping harassment from customers. (ye old the customer is always right problem) which i get\u2026 except for when it\u2019s CUSTOMERS yelling loudly that they don\u2019t want a tranny working at THEIR panera and demanding that management fires the tranny. (me btw)\ntook having a new manager (not gm though) seeing me crying in the back\u2026 for any manager (her) to blow up at the customer the next time he came in telling him that there was a panera a mile down the road, and that if he didn\u2019t like the associates he could go to that one.\n\nnot letting things go:\nalso have a manager who is really nice, right up until you get cut or break a plate, then it\u2019s screaming rage monster. and that manager also holds things over people\u2019s heads. when i first started working at panera, i had also just started nee medication (that made me really dizzy) one day it got so bad that I asked to go home early \u2014 by like 2 hours on a 7 hour shift where i was so out of it that i was causing more problems for everyone else. ever since then, if i so much as look like i have a headache, he tells me i\u2019m always going home early because of a minor issue (i didn\u2019t drive home that day, i called someone to pick me up since i knew i could drive). i\u2019ve been working at panera for 3 days a week since august (part time job) and the dizzy spell was my 10th shift. he still harps on it.\n\nthese are my stories\u2026 but it\u2019s my personal view on managers not doing their jobs.\nshort:\ndon\u2019t treat customers as gods over the well being of your employees and don\u2019t act like the rare times someone needs to be human are a big no no. \u2014 if someone is calling out every 2 shifts or going home early every single night, yeah take issue with that, but not when they have a legitimate reason.\n\nalso saw a gm fired for sexually harassment of both boys and girls (and only the ones still in highschool) \u2014 don\u2019t do it, don\u2019t allow it\u2026 not from you, other managers, or anyone else\u2026 employees or customers.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/PaneraEmployees\/comments\/rxwafp\/im_a_new_assistant_manager\/hsn8leg\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"PaneraEmployees","reddit_link_id":"t3_rxwafp","reddit_parent_id":"t3_rxwafp","reddit_submission":"rxwafp"},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2022-01-21T02:03:54","reddit_id":"htkj062","reddit_name":"t1_htkj062","reddit_created_utc":1642748634,"reddit_author":"Loose-Airline-1555","reddit_text":"Don\u2019t be a office manager. Team members don\u2019t care if your in the office working on the schedule. If there is a rush, you better be out there helping them. This becomes a problem because team members don\u2019t often know how many things you have going on... so you could be on the phone with a customer, put them on hold and an team member will expect you to go grab them some chipotle sauce. You need to be able to delegate tiny tasks like that to team members that aren\u2019t doing anything. Otherwise you will become overwhelmed and the team member will assume you are just a lazy office manager. Team members don\u2019t care about how many people you hired that day, they only care that you care about them. SO stay active, schedule yourself admin time outside of busy times. Hire based on needs.. one manager, one person on line, a register and a drive thru order taker won\u2019t do. If that\u2019s all you have, you better be available to help.\n\nTraining- There\u2019s suppose to be a specific amount of days that associates train in certain areas. You need to be sure to check in with those trainee\u2019s and find out where they need more practice on, before you schedule them in position. A common problem is that AGM\u2019s schedule associates in areas that they don\u2019t know very well. The scheduling system has tried to stop this by not allowing you to schedule people in area\u2019s that the associates aren\u2019t certified in.. but often, AGM\u2019s will just have associate\u2019s spend their first few days doing all their e-learning.. so they can schedule them anywhere.  TRAINING is definitely key to having happy team members.\n\nCommunication- It is important that you find a way to communicate with your other manager\u2019s.. WHERE and WHO the new hires will be training with. I would often.. highlight on the schedule the shifts that the trainers would be training on.. so they would know. Team leads hate when you just throw a trainee on them. You can also let your fellow managers know via email or write on deployment charts this as well. THIS makes it so the trainee isn\u2019t walking into a shift and having a manager throw them somewhere they have never trained before.. and ultimately throwing off their training plan.\n\nI have been a manager for 10 years, was recently demoted to a team manager because my store was shut down. BUT the biggest complaint I receive from staff is that other employees aren\u2019t doing their part. Every shift needs to be set up to succeed. SO it is important that you TIP\/TOP your staff and they know the expectations before they leave. They need to always be checked out by a manager. \n\nEveryone needs to be held up to the same standards. Once an employee sees another employee doing something they aren\u2019t suppose to be doing, they think they can get away with it too. If you correct one person, you must correct them all. \n\nDon\u2019t make just anyone a team lead because your TMM says you need 10 team leads by February. I always argued about this. THE numbers shouldn\u2019t matter. QUALITY is key. Same with hiring, only hire QUALITY. Will this person fit well with the team? Does this person seem motivated? Does this person  only want to work at Panera because of the money or do they actually like the company? Does this person want a future with Panera?","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/PaneraEmployees\/comments\/rxwafp\/im_a_new_assistant_manager\/htkj062\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"PaneraEmployees","reddit_link_id":"t3_rxwafp","reddit_parent_id":"t3_rxwafp","reddit_submission":"rxwafp"},{"aware_post_type":"submission","aware_created_ts":"2022-01-06T18:25:26","reddit_id":"rxs423","reddit_name":"t3_rxs423","reddit_created_utc":1641511526,"reddit_author":"rox-nne","reddit_text":"","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/PaneraEmployees\/comments\/rxs423\/not_a_catering_location_so_tell_me_why\/","reddit_title":"Not a catering location, so tell me ~why~","reddit_url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/kpy4avu0j5a81.jpg","reddit_subreddit":"PaneraEmployees","reddit_link_id":null,"reddit_parent_id":null,"reddit_submission":null},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2022-01-06T19:31:33","reddit_id":"hrkhfar","reddit_name":"t1_hrkhfar","reddit_created_utc":1641515493,"reddit_author":"slikid_","reddit_text":"It just gets worse the more I look at it.

We will call her manager 1. She was nice when I first started, about two months ago, but lately she\u2019s been really nasty. Last Sunday was one of the worst days. \nI was the only cashier from 2-10pm because my other coworker yelled at a customer, so she got put on dish. It wasn\u2019t super busy but being the only cashier was hard. I was grabbing gloves because I ran out, and when I got back manager 1 called me over. She said \u201cHow come every time a customer comes in you disappear? I end up having to greet them and it is not my job\u201d the customers she was talking about I had already greeted and they weren\u2019t ready yet.\nAfter my 15 at around 8 I decided to make myself a sandwich because i was super ahead of my close. When I got back my manager started following me and complaining about me being on line for two minutes. She was so aggressive and I almost started crying because of how confrontational she had been the whole night.\nRight before we closed the lady who always orders all 5 of the blind bags came in. She is super rude and always complains about what\u2019s in the bags. Manager 1 forgot to make them and said \u201coopsies\u201d (literally) and I ended up having to make them. The lady was staring at me the whole time and it was very uncomfortable. \nI ended up closing at 9:20, faster than anyone else and somewhat earlier than closing usually is. My other coworkers closed at 10 on line so there was no reason for her to be mad at me. I took my things and left when she dismissed us. \nShe texted me a few days ago because she wanted to repair the relationship between her and my other coworkers, including me. My coworker who I knew before workin at Panera gave her advice about talking to me, \u201cdon\u2019t make it into a lecture\u201d. \nOf course before even asking me she went on about what she thought I was mad about and explaining that it was her job to be strict and rude. I told her it wasn\u2019t a good solution to yell at us, and it was my job to and I was dreading it because of her. I ended the convo because I was hanging out with friends and it was killing my mood. \nI\u2019ve found out that she posted mean things about my coworker on Twitter and has a secret Instagram so she can \u201cname drop people without any consequences\u201d. If her behavior doesn\u2019t change me and a few other coworkers will be taking all of this to our GM. Im closing with her tonight so I will post an update.\n\nEdit: things are a lot better now, eventually she realized what she was doing and laid back a little more","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/PaneraEmployees\/comments\/qe9i0h\/my_manager_is_out_of_control\/","reddit_title":"My manager is out of control","reddit_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/PaneraEmployees\/comments\/qe9i0h\/my_manager_is_out_of_control\/","reddit_subreddit":"PaneraEmployees","reddit_link_id":null,"reddit_parent_id":null,"reddit_submission":null},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2021-10-24T02:07:06","reddit_id":"hhtz67j","reddit_name":"t1_hhtz67j","reddit_created_utc":1635055626,"reddit_author":"pretzelbagel","reddit_text":"Sounds like you should gather info on her social media accounts and forward the findings to HR.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/PaneraEmployees\/comments\/qe9i0h\/my_manager_is_out_of_control\/hhtz67j\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"PaneraEmployees","reddit_link_id":"t3_qe9i0h","reddit_parent_id":"t3_qe9i0h","reddit_submission":"qe9i0h"},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2022-02-01T16:29:48","reddit_id":"hv6ru28","reddit_name":"t1_hv6ru28","reddit_created_utc":1643750988,"reddit_author":"gin_up","reddit_text":"^this, but make sure that they're not friends with the HR person cuz that can backfire on you","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/PaneraEmployees\/comments\/qe9i0h\/my_manager_is_out_of_control\/hv6ru28\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"PaneraEmployees","reddit_link_id":"t3_qe9i0h","reddit_parent_id":"t1_hhtz67j","reddit_submission":"qe9i0h"},{"aware_post_type":"submission","aware_created_ts":"2021-10-19T16:08:28","reddit_id":"qbjrjo","reddit_name":"t3_qbjrjo","reddit_created_utc":1634674108,"reddit_author":"None","reddit_text":"Lady claimed an allergy to tomatoes *and* onions, and then proceeded to say she ordered a greek salad and got \"a whole handful\" of onions and tomatoes.

I\u2019ve been there for 5 years. I suspect he\u2019s mad at me for taking two days off due to having a bad reaction to the Covid vaccine. (Temp of 103)  As far as managing employees goes, everyone\u2019s texting, talking on the phone, among other things. I have rarely ever talked on the phone, and on this one day I did in fact talk on the phone for about 7-8 minutes. 1. I see others talking on the phone for longer periods of time, managers do it(not to customers) and I was on dish with not a dish to do. \n        I know that doesn\u2019t excuse my talking on the phone. Nobody, including myself should be doing it anyway. \n\nNow it\u2019s the reaction and choice of the GM here that has Me confused. The manager of that night must have told him I was on the phone. That\u2019s fine. That\u2019s her job I\u2019m sure.   The person I was on the phone with was a former manager I\u2019m good friends with to this day. She hasn\u2019t worked at Panera for over 1 year+.  \n\nThe GM, rather than texting me, and talking to ME about the problem he had with ME on MY shift, he texts her: someone who does not work at Panera, I quote:  \u201cYou\u2019re going to get ________ fired if you keep talking to him on his shifts. \ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude33\ud83e\udd17\ud83e\udd17\u201d sends another text: \u201chow are you doing though? How\u2019s the fam?\u201d \n\nI\u2019m sure to some that may not even sound bad. But I feel singled out and disrespected. I\u2019ve never even remotely had my name and the word \u201cfired\u201d in the same sentence. For 5 years it\u2019s been nothing but respect between me and him. I do absolutely every single thing asked of me with no question by every manager. If any one of them would have just told me \u201chey can you get off the phone?\u201d I\u2019d happily say okay and That would have been the end of it.  \nI was written up once 3 years ago for a separate incident involved with delivery.(different manager)\nI would have even understood being written up for talking on the phone in that case. \nBut to not even talk to me about potentially firing me? To threaten me through somebody who doesn\u2019t even work at Panera? That infuriates me. It impacted me in such a way that when I found out he sent that to her during my shift I had a panic attack and it impacted my work for the day. Made me slow. \nThis guy is infamous for not liking conflict.  But he needs to do what a General Manager does and Manage. Either talk to me, or give me my second write up, and then fire me on the third. It\u2019s always been 3 strikes and you\u2019re out, (I thought) \n\nObviously there\u2019s nothing I can do about it. I mostly just want to know,  that isn\u2019t proper coming from a GM? Correct? That\u2019s wrong isn\u2019t it?\n\nEdited: an extra detail.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/PaneraEmployees\/comments\/oja52q\/this_doesnt_seem_right_for_a_gm_to_do\/","reddit_title":"This doesn\u2019t seem right for a GM to do.","reddit_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/PaneraEmployees\/comments\/oja52q\/this_doesnt_seem_right_for_a_gm_to_do\/","reddit_subreddit":"PaneraEmployees","reddit_link_id":null,"reddit_parent_id":null,"reddit_submission":null},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2021-07-31T16:43:48","reddit_id":"h78omnf","reddit_name":"t1_h78omnf","reddit_created_utc":1627764228,"reddit_author":"kevin_r13","reddit_text":"Any chance he was joking?

I've never even heard of an automatic interview invitation before, so I guess they must be.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/PaneraEmployees\/comments\/nm4l2k\/is_a_anyones_panera_this_desperate_for_workers_too\/htgowng\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"PaneraEmployees","reddit_link_id":"t3_nm4l2k","reddit_parent_id":"t3_nm4l2k","reddit_submission":"nm4l2k"},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2022-06-21T01:00:39","reddit_id":"id5c5ic","reddit_name":"t1_id5c5ic","reddit_created_utc":1655787639,"reddit_author":"None","reddit_text":"Yes we were putting them in to go and delivery orders for a while","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/PaneraEmployees\/comments\/nm4l2k\/is_a_anyones_panera_this_desperate_for_workers_too\/id5c5ic\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"PaneraEmployees","reddit_link_id":"t3_nm4l2k","reddit_parent_id":"t3_nm4l2k","reddit_submission":"nm4l2k"},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2021-05-27T19:22:56","reddit_id":"gzp312o","reddit_name":"t1_gzp312o","reddit_created_utc":1622157776,"reddit_author":"Shakespeare-Bot","reddit_text":"We has't this too\u2026and we\u2019re giving people free bagels if 't be true they entreatment\n\n***\n\n\n\n^(I am a bot and I swapp'd some of thy words with Shakespeare words.)\n\nCommands: `!ShakespeareInsult`, `!fordo`, `!optout`","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/PaneraEmployees\/comments\/nm4l2k\/is_a_anyones_panera_this_desperate_for_workers_too\/gzp312o\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"PaneraEmployees","reddit_link_id":"t3_nm4l2k","reddit_parent_id":"t1_gzp2zod","reddit_submission":"nm4l2k"},{"aware_post_type":"submission","aware_created_ts":"2021-05-23T15:34:30","reddit_id":"njf8r3","reddit_name":"t3_njf8r3","reddit_created_utc":1621798470,"reddit_author":"WayMean360","reddit_text":"","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/PaneraEmployees\/comments\/njf8r3\/whats_really_cool_about_working_at_panera_is_you\/","reddit_title":"What\u2019s really cool about working at Panera is you can tell a lot about someone based on their order.

We've never had one of those before in my 5 years of third shift baking until now\n\nSince our new franchise owner took over, he took EVERYTHING away from us. Raises, vacation time, paid leave, bonuses, took away our security system, refused to get equipment fixed, opened up new stores while the current ones in the region are severely understaffed. \n\nDuring the height of covid, we got reduced hours and within a month raised the hours back to where it was just enough to not have to pay us unemployment but not be our full time hours and that's STILL going on.\n\nMy bakes are bigger than ever even before covid times. We have a few bakers rotating between 4 cafes because we're so short staffed and they keep opening more stores.\n\nThis past week my oven broke down and I've been doing my bakes at the closest cafe and hauling it all back to my cafe. They wanted to transfer me to the new store which is a 45 minute drive and I asked about a raise to cover gas and mileage and ware and tear and some extra because I havent seen a raise in over 3.5 years. They went silent and never got back to me\n\nAnyway, they gave us third shift bakers $20 each in target gift cards. Insulting but at the same time I'm glad we're being somewhat recognized for what we've been going through but I would much rather have my normal hours back.\n\nConsidering what other jobs have been giving current and new employees this is an absolute joke.

It'll be crowded but they'll fit. I also work on the next few trays while I have one tray drying and one tray actively in the dishwasher. Start with one and work up to two, three, and sometimes four depending on what kinds of dishes you have to do. When you get one tray queued up and ready to go in, that's when I go and unload the drying tray and put things on the dry rack. \n\nI stack 9 and 6 pans right behind the spot where the dish trays first get pushed out of the washer. This frees up a lot of time and I put them away when I have very few dishes to work on\/none. \n\nWhen I send through the interior line rods\/metal things (lol) I try to send them through on a flat dish tray and then stack another dish tray on top. Either another flat with the other line interior pieces or just a regular tray with miscellaneous other dishes. I separate silverware by type and stack them on three different flat dish trays. Three stack is pushing it though. \n\nI always rinse everything before it goes in. I find the easiest way to ensure stuff comes out clean by doing this. However you can be fast about it. Have a sink filled with hot soapy water and dunk easy stuff in (chicken pans, tomato pans, etc) and let more gunked stuff sit for a little in the water (teriyaki pans, rice bowl pans, etc). The former will rinse off easier with the sprayer immediately and the latter after soaking for a bit. \n\nI tell my fellow line people to de-sticker EVERYTHING before putting it on the cart to send to the dish pit. Try and encourage those around you to de-sticker things so you don't have to worry about peeling stickers off or missing stickers and them getting stuck and gunked in the bottom drain of the dishwasher. \n\nI'm jumping around a lot in my comment, lol sorry.

You can use the 3 sinks (I suggest 2 at least) and sometimes I even separated them bowls, plates, cups...\n\nDoing plates goes by the fastest. Cups to, they perfectly fit on a rack (I dont remember how many per rack, its been about a year)\n\nsoak the soup stuff, there is super dried up soup on the ladles and everything, and soaking helps soo much! \n\nBe careful dont cut yourself!. I get too stressed out one night and some how cut my finger, next day it was very infected. Thankfully, it went away. \n\nkeep at a steady pace! The machine takes time, so try and fill every rack (not too full tho) but keep the machine running, esp on busy nights. \n\nIf you run out of dishes, go around looking for them. First go to line, they usually have a build up. Sometimes too busy to bring stuff back. then dining, sometimes the person(s) on break or doing something else. then look for anything else. if it is late enough at night, ask for some of the barista (my store had 2 of each item, so Id wash 1 of each). Get the soup lids, ask to consolidate ny trays (from cash or line) so you can clean more. \n\nOn a slow night, sweep and mop the walk in, and any parts of the back room that most likely will not get dirty. Actually, it was easier to mop EVERYTHINg, then at the actual closing, you dont have to full blown scrub the floor, just a light mop. \n\nput EVERYTHING away, have time or no time, you will eventually have to do it anyway\n\nok, now some rule breaking tips...\n\nYou know those container thingy that line has to hold the food? Well, my store we had to put it on a top shelf, and I learned that 11 of the smallest can fit on the shelf (and recommended), 8 of the square, and the rectangle (for like, the chx), and 5 for the long one. It is most likely different for your store, but when you are washing all of those containers, do it in sections. Organize and wash all of the same size. So example, the small containers, wash and stack on the clean side of the washer, and every time you get to 10\/11, put the stack away.

I feel as a closer that our morning leads don\u2019t understand they too should share in the responsibility of making sure midwork is done. I\u2019ve come in at 4pm (we close at 7pm) and have found that during a slow lunch no midwork has been done, our eggcooker is filthy, and breakfast utensils are still left dirty on the line, and second line still hasn\u2019t been set up. Our dinner rush is at 5pm and they usually like leaving me with one other person until then and it\u2019s always new people that I\u2019m stuck with (three of us working line total, four if I\u2019m lucky) so that\u2019s fun. \n I\u2019m also the one lead that learned to do multiple areas on their own and has closed line, dish, dining room, and register. I help out everywhere if my area isn\u2019t busy with orders so that service is dandy. And sometimes, we get people that leave dining room a mess or there\u2019s too much that needs to be stocked out and stocked up. I try to help as much as I can or if I can\u2019t, I\u2019m also making sure others stay on task and help out each other too. \n So anyway, I can help out elsewhere and still get our midwork stuff done, clean the line, and get second line squared away way before 4pm depending on the pace of things. Sometimes it gets busy and then eases into steady and not everything gets done, we are human. However, other leads on line (there\u2019s four of us and only two do this) will not do anything outside of their station and will let work pile up until I get in. If I\u2019m there at 11am or the other guy is, stuff gets done. \n I came in for my 2pm the other day, it was a slow lunch but egg cooker and its area was filthy, trashcans full, no midwork done, second lines weren\u2019t set up, no lids on the stuff over there, no boxes folded, and I ended up being left with a trainee on her third day of work. It was just us two. Well upon making sure she was smooth and steady orders coming in- I was on sandwich, barista, and QC- all of those tasks were barely getting done. 5pm rolls around. We get two people for sandwich but it\u2019s now dinner rush and lasts until 6pm but now we also are doing preclose stuff on top of that since we close at 7pm. \n Well I was off at 7pm but stayed to help clean a little and forget to check the breakfast fridge. One of those team leads from previously mentioned confronts today me and mentions that it wasn\u2019t done and that the closers didn\u2019t set up the egg cooker and the breakfast pans correctly. Then I\u2019m told that as a lead it\u2019s my responsibility to ensure that these things get done... idk when midwork and cleaning became only my responsibility and why I would be the only lead out of the three of us there that day that should ensure it done along with everything else. I should have checked but I\u2019m human and I can forget... which I did.\n To make matters better, after I thought all closers had been doing a better job at checking dates, I lightened up on being a helicopter mom and checking behind them. Especially since I haven\u2019t heard any complaints from morning leads and I don\u2019t always close with them and nobody else has mentioned anything. Well, that same lead once again decides to mention how it\u2019s been done poorly the last month (she waited a month to tell me) and she was going to mention it and a list of things at the team lead meeting but it was cancelled. \n This isn\u2019t even fully detailed sadly... haaaa. I just felt cheated and used. Like I\u2019m the only one they can blame even though nobody else wanted to put forth effort. It\u2019s also kind of funny because those same leads don\u2019t date everything and some stuff has been fifoed poorly which once again builds up. It gets to be a little much when you\u2019re trying to close and label a bunch of stuff that has no labels or are told needs to be relabeled.\n I make $9.95 an hour and try to help out as much as I can everywhere. Like today for instance. I helped make salads, sandwiches, and pour soups even though I was on barista. I answered the phone and participated in dining room. It was a floating day that I didn\u2019t help on register but no matter where I\u2019m at on the line, I give a hand everywhere so long as I\u2019m caught up and fellow production members are caught up. It\u2019s just habit that I float and it\u2019s not expected of me to always float and help. \n What made that aforementioned 2-7pm shift more fun was that it was 2 (me and a trainee) production people, a cashier, and a manager with two drivers (either out on delivers or hiding) in the cafe. So it was inevitable that the cashier would need help even though I had steady orders. It just sucks that I could still be blamed when I\u2019m already doing as much as I can. I also hate confrontation and it\u2019d sound bad if I just rebutted with \u201cWell I also need help or XYZ done  so that it doesn\u2019t pile up until I get in on later shifts.\u201d It just sounds accusing when maybe we are both to blame. \n It\u2019s funny because I\u2019m also the one that is sometimes forced to be floating around by the GM. I could be doing a task just like everyone else but if a bunch of orders pop up then I\u2019m the one that should be focused on helping elsewhere or bagging\/prepping even though there are other leads and people on the line. I never know if I\u2019m not doing enough or just not the right stuff. I feel the favoritism thing is just an excuse for my part but it definitely feels like favorites are placed more days than others. And none of these guys are actually bad people. They\u2019re all really cool and nice, it\u2019s just one little thing that has me peeved and I wanted off my chest. I appreciate all of them. I wouldn\u2019t ever actually ask or force people to do more than necessary but I just want help sometimes too when  I\u2019m constantly busy. One coworker jokes that \u201cShe made the mistake of learning everything and they make sure she always does it all.\u201d Some days it feels more true than anything when I hear the GM say things like \u201cWhy don\u2019t you have her do XYZ or that or this.\u201d When I\u2019m cleaning or making something or doing whatever needs to be done.  Thanks for getting this far. I also don\u2019t think of quitting as I haven\u2019t been there a full year and this is also my second job. My first job I stayed a year even though it was a thousand times shittier but I care about making a resume look nice experience wise before getting another job. I\u2019m gonna stick this one out longer than a year but if after a year and a half things get worse then I\u2019ll slowly move  on. It just feels nice getting it off my chest. I really am making this worse than it sounds probably and letting stress get to me.

I started here almost a year ago at $9.50\/hour and when I got a raise we were promised it was $0.45. That\u2019s not bad to me but apparently I\u2019m making way less than others. Not only that but I\u2019m referred to as the versatile one. I was trained on production but trained myself to do register, dish, and dining room. Somebody needs help? I\u2019m your person. I\u2019ve also closed line, register, dining room, and dish. I have made the mistake of going ten extra mile only to learn there are favorites in our cafe and no matter how far I go, it\u2019s never enough and only more is wanted. I will come in early and help set up off the clock but then get yelled at that I\u2019m not watching a QC screen. Like excuse you GM, you have a $200 catering order that I know won\u2019t get done in time, lemme work on that while your current three line people make the orders.  Not to mention I\u2019m that one line person that can make and bag orders and then run it out to someone\u2019s car but others aren\u2019t expected to do that. One manager- the managers are all cool btw- jokes with me about how it really would be possible for me to take an order, prepare, and then run it out to someone\u2019s car. Which has been done before via phone order, wasn\u2019t a big one but I still did it. \nMy only thing is I\u2019m told by another lead that I do a shit ton throughout the day but they keep asking for more. I even stay extra to help out. That other team lead is like a big brother, he admits he wouldn\u2019t even do the amount that I do for his pay nor be cross-trained like that. \n I\u2019m in a fuck all mood right now though. I don\u2019t mind helping out everywhere. It\u2019s kind of fun making a salad, hopping over to QC, then being in the window to check a ticket, then hopping back over to QC more\/make a salad or barista, and cleaning between all the steady post-lunch orders. However, no morning person or opening team lead should come at me when I\u2019m doing all that, setting up second lines, and training a new person when they cant be bothered to stock a breakfast fridge. I\u2019m not going into too much detail about our team setup but I\u2019m sure you guys can all guess how it is. I close a lot but I\u2019ve been seen a little more in the mornings and until 7pm(closing time) rather than actually closing lately. I\u2019m that person that gets scheduled 11-8\/9pm three times in a week depending on the week\u2019s mood. On shorter shifts I either come in at 7am\/9am (then leave before 3pm) OR im in at 2\/4pm. Well, morning loves shoving all midwork until whoever is in for nights. Plus cleaning and setting up second line. Lunch will have 6-7 people on the line and if it\u2019s slow the egg cooker still won\u2019t be cleaned AND no midwork done unless the other dude and I am there. The other two team leads will set up, sit at their station and go while us other two hop around and do a bunch of cleaning and whatever else and making orders. \n I also don\u2019t close as much as I used to. I am pretty good about dates and felt that since I haven\u2019t heard any complaints in a while, fellow closers were doing a good job at them too without me there. Well, our team lead meeting gets canceled and I\u2019m now told by a morning team that they\u2019ve been doing terrible this last month with dates AND that she was waiting  until our meeting to bring up a whole list of things. I am told now that they\u2019ve been doing terrible. Should I have checked instead of trusted them? Yeah, I should\u2019ve. However, I\u2019m the youngest production person and have had coworkers tell me that double checking like that is insulting and micromanaging so I said fuck it. Someone wants to be pissy, fuck it. Not really, I stopped checking when seeing that they\u2019d double check each other and when the lines were in a constant good state of dates. \n However, she wanted to complain that when I left at 7pm on a particular day that the breakfast fridge wasn\u2019t even stocked and the breakfast pans and egg cooker weren\u2019t even set up and that since I\u2019m a lead it\u2019s my responsibility regardless of if I close. That particular day that I forgot to check, I came in at two. She and the other opening team lead didn\u2019t do anything else past open and stand at their stations when it was an easy production day. On a SLOW day at 2pm no boxes were folded, no midwork attempted, bars weren\u2019t put back into second line, QC2 was filthy, the egg cooker was a wreck and it\u2019s pieces weren\u2019t even taken back to dish yet. On top of all that, I was left with a trainee on her third day of training. Just me, her, and a steady pace of orders until 5pm when two other line people (both sandwich on one line) finally came in and we had to start preclose stuff as well since rush begins at 5pm and can last until 6:30pm. I don\u2019t think the morning leads realize that saving shit up until night means shit work always get done. Could I have checked? Yes but I\u2019m human and I forget. I was also told by a manager that it was a closing managers fault for not also checking behind the two closers as I was off at 7pm granted I stayed back cleaned a little before leaving around 7:15-20 so they could stay caught up. \n Those morning leads only set up and once it\u2019s done, they don\u2019t do much. Once their time comes to go, they don\u2019t offer to do anything. When their time is 15 minutes away they RARELY (once in a blue moon rare) ask if there\u2019s anything they can do. I\u2019m nice and keep it small like stocking up QC or cleaning as then I can focus on midwork or have someone help me with that instead so it can get done. I respect their time though because nobody should work past their time or more unless they choose to. However, nobody should come after another person when they can\u2019t be bothered to do anything while it\u2019s slow past whatever is at their station. Breakfast fridge wasn\u2019t stocked but you had a slow shift? Ain\u2019t my fault you added it to one of the billion things I had to do. \n I just felt disrespected by that and have felt so a bunch more lately. I already fear not doing enough but I don\u2019t want to be used and pushed around for the benefit of others to slack too. Like when I float on the line, I float everywhere so long as line is squared away. I float even when I\u2019m not a floater. Salad screen isn\u2019t getting any orders? Sandwich and QC don\u2019t got much happening but register needs help? Got you bro. Phone ringing? Hello this is Panera at \u2014\u2014. Too many curbsides? Let\u2019s do it. Coffees need to be changed? Well, not a problem. Meanwhile we got leads sitting at their station while everything else happens around them. \n It\u2019s also been expected of me more to float as I do. If I were to sit for even a second with no salad on screen it\u2019s \u201cWhy isn\u2019t she doing this?\u201d \n GM forgot I was off at 1:30pm today but I stayed and helped because we got slammed when second line was cut off at 1pm. We had three people remain on the line at two, one manager was helping and GM went \u201cWhy isn\u2019t she CQing?\u201d Uhm... she was supposed to be off a 1:30. But no, help was needed in dining room AND line so she freaking helped and got barista and breakfast fridge squared away and cleaned.

The bread and pastries used to be baked overnight, and served fresh when the cafe opens. Summer of 2022 they dissolved all 3rd shift positions and forced all bakers onto 2nd shift. So now, when you eat at panera, just know that everything was baked the night before, and is 10 hours old before the cafe opens and serves it to you. If you go at dinner time, everything is already a day old. Yea, you see bakers baking - but it's all for the next day.

Here\u2019s a summary of what I experienced: \nI was given harsh eye rolls whenever I had a panic attack over being extremely stressed with the work, which was caused by their insistent and predatory like behavior, rushing me to get things done by bringing up my lack of focus, singling me out in front of my coworkers for talking even though in other circumstances when not present nothing is said. They treated my anxiety and adhd as a burden from the get go, inherently making those conditions even worse due to extra stress. They also hated when I wanted to leave on time to check in with mom, who has had severe Covid along with chronic illness since March, and all I wanted to do was to make sure she was alive and breathing. In general I was talked down to constantly, and judged me not being able to do something I was ever trained for, and just did it themselves instead of teaching me. \n\nSorry for the long rant but I must say my new job at a grocery chain is so much better. I haven\u2019t felt judged because of my mother, my anxiety\/adhd, or my lack of experience. They actually trained me instead of having a 17 year old roll her eyes every time I asked a question during training. I know nobody specifically asked how I was doing, but I wanted to share. I hope you all are being treated better than I was.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/PaneraEmployees\/comments\/ihd39k\/im_doing_so_much_better\/","reddit_title":"I\u2019m doing so much better","reddit_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/PaneraEmployees\/comments\/ihd39k\/im_doing_so_much_better\/","reddit_subreddit":"PaneraEmployees","reddit_link_id":null,"reddit_parent_id":null,"reddit_submission":null},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2020-08-26T23:01:48","reddit_id":"g2zfk5m","reddit_name":"t1_g2zfk5m","reddit_created_utc":1598497308,"reddit_author":"areed2468","reddit_text":"My store also increased the amount of hours you have to do for a 30 min break from 5 1\/2 to 8.

My state made new minimum wage laws so my six mounts raises haven\u2019t even been able to keep up with that. Currently the minimum wage in my state is 9.50 (which got changed on January 1st) my six minute was a month after hat so I make 9.69. I told my AM and GM in February that i wasn\u2019t happy with making 0.16\/hr more then people that are just starting for the work that I do. I requested 10.0\/hr and they said they would talk to the DM. After about a month of asking when they were going to talk to him, they finally did and said that I was going to get the raise, and should expect it on the next paycheck.\n\nThen, COVID happened and apparently I never got the raise I was promised and have been working through a pandemic for 0.16 above minimum wage, and what our new hires are at, while I\u2019ve been there for 2 years now and am worth about 2 people. \n\nI closed tonight and ended up closing line, drive, and dining room. And got everyone out at 9 (we closed at 8) my shift pulled me aside and wanted to give me gift cards to show that he valued my work, and said that he tried to talk to the GM about my pay, but he said he didn\u2019t get anywhere. I\u2019ve been the main production person at night for about a year, and have had to deal with reduced man power, working one line every night, 3 people running all of dinner on our most busy day of the week.\n\nOnce I found out that I didn\u2019t get the raise I asked my GM to see what happened, and she said that the paperwork got messed up due to COVID and she sent an email, however she was very vague about what the email said and I\u2019m not sure if she was asking what happened or was asking if I am going to get my raise. I also want back pay from what I didn\u2019t get for the 3 months I worked with out it. \n\nSo I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to get a raise, and I\u2019m planning on keeping my summer hours and going online for my senior year, but I don\u2019t know if I want to work for a company that cares so little. I\u2019m also upset at the fact that if my GM would have just sent an email to the DM in February, instead of waiting for them to come in the caf\u00e9 and forgetting for 2-3 weeks, then I wouldn\u2019t even be having this problem. \n\nShould I stay, look for a new job, ask for even more?

So hello. I\u2019ve worked at Panera since they opened in my city in 2016. I was 17 at the time, freshman in college, and I trained to help open the store. I work very hard. I stood out early on and was quickly promoted to Trainer (Black Hat). I worked my way up to Shift Supervisor, doing mid shifts for about 6 months. In January, I went to train for the official position. I impressed the caf\u00e9 there and came back to my home store with a tough and ready attitude. \n\nTo give some backstory. My GM is a tiny hurricane, and she basically has been everyone\u2019s gay mom since she came into the position 3.5 years ago. The staff in the beginning had a weirdly high percentage of queer people for a Deep South restaurant. She took us all in, offered us a place of sanctuary, and genuinely cared about her employees, their mental and physical well being. I\u2019ve stayed for so long because I LOVE my coworkers and my boss. I love my caf\u00e9. Our customers are heinous, but we have the most tight-knit group I have ever seen in the food service industry. I would tell friends in other restaurants about how the place is like wonderland, and they wouldn\u2019t believe me. Everyone is respectful. Everyone gets along. Everyone is family. We are all very different and just got along so well. The whole caf\u00e9 would just come in and straight vibe. It is a wonderful place to exist and work because the humans there make it so. \n\nAnd then the store shut down for 2 weeks in mid-March with a confirmed Covid case. Before we shut down, the caf\u00e9 was an absolute powerhouse. After we opened back up, even with the dining room closed, we quickly began beating projections daily. Weekly. Monthly. All without a GM. Now, I don\u2019t blame my GM for being gone on reopening. Her mother had just passed away, and she had to take care of her family first. \n\nThe only people left to run the store were myself and our 8 months pregnant AM. We had had another shift, but he walked out on me on my second closing shift alone (different long story he\u2019s fine it\u2019s fine). So, the DM sent a couple of managers from other caf\u00e9s to help us stay afloat. Our AM was out save working random shifts to help us, so I was the highest ranking person in that caf\u00e9 that was not a visiting manager. Which directly translated into me acting as the GM (save some paperwork) until mine returned. In that time, I fought tooth and nail to keep my associates protected from the amount of overwork my DM was trying to subject them to. Trying to open the dining room before our city allowed, trying to allow customers to come inside to order before the city allowed, trying to tell me these managers they sent me were actually worth something, trying to have people work all day because we were only open 8-8. I was constantly worrying over them, constantly trying to pick up the slack from the visiting managers. We were constantly working in position because we were given little to no hours but still beating projections weekly. I got burnt out before I really had a chance to get my bearings on the position. \n\nI currently make 12\/hr there. Our higher ups have, even though we beat projections by 1-1.5k daily, reduced us to 88 hours a day. (Labor scheduling projects us at 110-120 daily). It is always a struggle. No matter how much I love my associates, I feel like I\u2019m dying with these 50+ hr weeks working in position and running shifts since May. My body is quite literally breaking down on me. I\u2019ve spent the past ~5 months worrying over them, trying to help them in every way I can while on shift because they don\u2019t make enough to deal with a pandemic and corporate bullshit. \n\nI\u2019ve just come to the realization that 12 doesn\u2019t feel like enough to deal with corporate bullshit and the break down of my joints, either. I was offered a 14\/hr position in a lateral move position-wise but in a real restaurant. With more chances of upward mobility at a higher pay rate while dealing with the same corporate bullshit. It feels like a no brainer, but I am absolutely heart broken. I finished growing up there. I formed the skills necessary to move on there. But it hurts. It\u2019s like leaving family, and there is a nagging suspicion constantly that I am making the wrong decision. I love my humans. I love my caf\u00e9.. but I don\u2019t see myself making more than 12 because my GM, when confronted about a raise at any point, reminds me that AMs only make 13 and shuts it down immediately. So what\u2019s the point? Why allow myself to be overworked when there is better? Why do I love these humans so much?\n\nAnyways. I guess this is my final, last ditch reaffirmation that I should leave. I feel more at peace thinking about the new job than this one, but it\u2019s still mid-pandemic. Still hurts leaving the people who have pretty much become my only friends. Still stressful. Basically.

They had an opportunity here to show that they care about their employees and their wellbeing but they blew it. I understand that many other restaurants are remaining open during this time, which can be a much needed paycheck for people struggling to get by, but is that really the reason Panera chose to remain open? If that were the case, and Panera cared about their employees, they would have told their GM's to ask their employees what their needs were during this pandemic, how badly did they need hours. I personally live at home with my parents and have a strong safety net so I do not need to work during this quarantine to provide for my basic necessities, whereas other employees of my store do. Despite telling my mangers this several times my work hours have not been cut at all and I'm working every day this week. This is only because I'm a driver and also trained on all the food stations as well as the cash register. My managers prioritized who they kept on by how well they worked and how many different stations they were trained on, instead of by who needed the hours. It's hard to blame the managers for wanting to prioritize this way, but Panera Corporate could have instructed their GM's to prioritize employees who needed hours. They did not, and now there are people struggling that don't need to be. \n\nMy second complaint is Panera's lack of compensating their employees for extra work and for hazardous work conditions. Starting today my Panera location is required to wear masks at all times. We previously weren't required, but most employees still did so. If the risk of infecting other employees is so high that we're required to wear medical equipment to do our jobs, why are we not getting compensation for putting our lives at higher risk? Either the work area is not hazardous and masks should not be required, or it is a hazardous work area, masks should be worn, and employees should receive hazard pay. Also, at my location there are only two employees and one manager in the store from open until 12, which makes for a much higher workload for each employee. Call me old fashioned, but I believe that when people do more work, they should be paid more for their effort. \n\nLast, I'd like to point out that Panera is not an essential business, as well as every other restaurant. An essential business is one that, if it closed, people would start dying or falling ill. No one will die if Panera closes its doors for a couple months. The only reason for a non-essential business to stay open during this time is if it can be safe (doubtful in any food environment), and they're providing much needed work hours for people struggling to feed their families and pay rent. Panera has already shown that they're not concerned with which of their employees need help, so what other reason are they open besides making more money for themselves?\n\nIn summary Panera has let down their employees by remaining open as a non-essential business, making no effort to identify which of their employees need hours and which don't, and by not compensating the employees they have kept on for extra work and for placing them in a much more dangerous position than if they were in their homes.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/PaneraEmployees\/comments\/g6u3pj\/an_open_letter_to_panera\/","reddit_title":"An Open Letter to Panera","reddit_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/PaneraEmployees\/comments\/g6u3pj\/an_open_letter_to_panera\/","reddit_subreddit":"PaneraEmployees","reddit_link_id":null,"reddit_parent_id":null,"reddit_submission":null},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2020-04-23T23:42:06","reddit_id":"foeb488","reddit_name":"t1_foeb488","reddit_created_utc":1587699726,"reddit_author":"LibbieBites","reddit_text":"The reason restaurants that could survive on take out alone stayed open is because if all restaurants closed the grocery stores and chains would not be able to handle the demand. We all saw what happened with toilet paper and cleaning supplies. If restaurants closed that would have happened with food. Having restaurants stay open prevented a panic regarding food. \n\nIt sucks that Panera prioritised the way it did. The reason they cut people who aren't crosstrained is because if it gets busy, you need people who know how to do everything. My store cut people who weren't crosstrained first. Luckily my gm is wonderful, and then cut people who had a suport network. She cut the highschoolers, everyone who didn't have bills. The few of us that stayed are those who live on our own, moving out in less than a month, or are single parents.\n We got lucky.\n\nOur work isn't legally considered hazardous. Fuck, nurses and hospital staff aren't considered in a hazardous workplace in my state. In my franchise, we weren't allowed to wear masks until yesterday.\nWe weren't allowed!

The franchise I work for (starts with a capital C) doesn\u2019t really care about anything except quick cash grabs. Maybe I just had a wider field of vision on the caf\u00e9 after training on each area, but suddenly the environment started turning into one where things would constantly change, lack of communication always occurred, and things became stressful and annoying because we\u2019d try something new only to have it fail because it wasn\u2019t efficient and the thought process behind it made no sense and then we\u2019d try again six months later like it was a brand new idea. I know some other businesses have issues similar to this and I know I can be very critical of things so I tried to take into account things I might not see or realize, but what started really disillusioning me was the fake \u201cwe\u2019re a family\u201d corporate PR stuff people would pull and just how fake things were. I watched my co-worker friends make so much less money busting their butts while newer employees people paid much higher did less. They say they pride themselves in certain values, but they don\u2019t actually care about investing into their employees to create that environment. You can\u2019t just tell your employees to do this and expect it to be an authentic connection and environment between customers and workers if they don\u2019t actually believe you are investing in those said values yourself. I used to dread coming to work all through last year. And this pandemic just reconfirmed what I already knew: they could care less about their workers. They are either laying people off or putting people at risk but not compensating them for putting their workers\u2019 health at risk. On top of that, people aren\u2019t even still taking it seriously or decisions are just counterproductive. Our lobby is shut down and we are only doing carry-outs, but there was literally a farewell party thrown for a co-worker and it angered me so so so much because THE LONGER PEOPLE DON\u2019T TAKE IT SERIOUSLY THE LONGER IT GOES ON AND THEY AREN\u2019T CARING ABOUT MY HEALTH! And then they want to start marketing and telling us to tell our friends and family that we are still open! Like STFU. Why should I care about helping you get business when you could care less about what happens to me as your employee? The \u201cfamily\u201d talk is so fake and I can\u2019t stand it anymore. Sorry for getting angry and ranting. I had a stressful day at work yesterday and I\u2019m going back in today, though I know there are some people who wish that they had a job, so I know I\u2019m privileged in that sense. But I stayed here so long and put up with so much because I didn\u2019t have enough self respect to leave, but now I know how much I am worth as an employee and after this pandemic is all over, I\u2019m going to put my two weeks in and find a job that values me as an employee and that I can stand working for. One that I\u2019ll want to help make money for because I know they\u2019ll invest opportunities and benefits into me.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/PaneraEmployees\/comments\/fwo1cs\/people_arent_taking_it_seriously_and_they_dont\/","reddit_title":"People aren\u2019t taking it seriously and they don\u2019t care about us :(","reddit_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/PaneraEmployees\/comments\/fwo1cs\/people_arent_taking_it_seriously_and_they_dont\/","reddit_subreddit":"PaneraEmployees","reddit_link_id":null,"reddit_parent_id":null,"reddit_submission":null},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2020-04-07T19:51:05","reddit_id":"fmqo35s","reddit_name":"t1_fmqo35s","reddit_created_utc":1586303465,"reddit_author":"lex-bean","reddit_text":"I was having the almost the exact same issues \ud83d\ude2d. \nI left about a month and a half before all this corona stuff started to work on Getting my life insurance license because I was sick of Panera and their lies.

We had holiday bread that year, I was but a lonely cashier waiting for the rest of night shift to arrive. Everything is going well. There is a lul in customers from 3:30 to about 4:30, as per usual.\nAt 4 o'clock is when this lady walks in.\nBottle dye red hair, heavily teased. Classic 2005 bump on top. Blue eyeshadow, glossy pink lips. Horrible contour that's not blended. She's wearing a cheetah print silk blouse with a tan fleece overoats, and the skinniest fucking pair Red Jeans the world has ever seen.\nIn her hands she is holding the previous years barrel bag. That is to say it had the previous year's design on it. She comes up to the counter very angrily sauntering around like she owns the place. She slams the bag down on the counter, startling me out of my inner monologue of oh shit this woman is a Karen.\n The conversation went like this. \nMe: your underpaid Panera employee. HBL: Holiday bread lady, our crazy customer. GM: the general manager.\n\nHBL: I demand a refund and free holiday bread *shoving a receipt in my face*\nMe: *quite startled but just trying to do my job, I take the reciept* of course ma'am, what was the problem with the order?\nHBL: I bought this bread 4 days ago and it's stale! That's ridiculous! Every other time I buy bread and always last at least two weeks!\nMe: well ma'am, our food doesn't have any preservatives in it and it's made fresh every day. It only lasts maybe a week at best. *I can see the rage in her eyes. I don't get paid enough for this.* let me go get my manager to see what I can do for you.\n\nAt this point I leave to the back. Sadly the only manager on duty at the time was the general manager, who hates being bothered by ridiculous customers who don't know how to breathe and walk at the same time. \nI give her a quick synopsis of what had just transpired on our way up to the cash registers where this lady is.\n\nGm: what seems to be the problem miss?\nHBL:This bread is stale!\nMy gm takes the receipt. The date was 2 weeks previous when we had just started selling the holiday bread. And the receipt was from a different store in the city. Still the same company but a different store.\nGm: ma'am there is nothing I can do for you here. This was bought from a different location. Not to mention at the bread is two weeks old.\nHBL starts to yell about how we need to refund her and give her free food as an apology. At this point another cashier clocks in and I get to go on break. I quickly went out back to smoke my worries away, So I didn't witness the rest; however, I do know what happened from my gm and the other cashier.\n\nThe one sided yelling continued for 20 minutes. The woman finding every little detail she can to complain about. At the end of it I take no bullshit GM decided to just say fuck it and gave the woman a new holiday bread And a gift card (that she didn't activate and had no money on it) While taking the old bread. \n\nWhen I came back from break my GM called me into the office laughing. She told me to touch the old holiday bread she took from the lady. \nIt. Was. Frozen.\nThis lady add Frozen less than 1\/2 of a holiday bread from 2017, purchased a new holiday bread two weeks prior came in with the old holiday bread in order to get a new one.\nI wish I had a satisfying end but luckily this lady never came back.

We have one lady who comes in every so often and always has a new stupid complaint to make in an attempt to get free food. Last time I saw her I asked if she had a Panera card and she told me no. I finish the transaction, give her the receipt and then she yells that she didn\u2019t get her \u201cpoints\u201d so my shift supervisor comes up and tells her there\u2019s nothing she can do for her and that she can claim the visit online. Karen didn\u2019t like that one bit. She starts yelling that she needs to give her a free pick two because of this huge inconvenience. Thankfully my shift supervisor doesn\u2019t just give into these people and tells her no. Eventually we got tired of her yelling and gave her a free muffin. 2 minutes later she comes up to me and tells me that she didn\u2019t get her chips. We all know the chips were in her bag but at this point I don\u2019t get paid enough to deal with her so I just gave her another bag of chips. Oh and to add to all this she repeated over and over that the order was to-go and not to charge her tax, then she plopped herself down at a table and ate.

Ask to speak with a manager or trainer, (manager is who you want but they may be busy and a trainer should know where the info is in store)\nAsk the person for the general managers number, and corporate email. \nIT IS LISTED IN THE STORE\nIf they don't want to give it to you\nGo online to Panera bread . com\nGo to the contact us\nEmail\nCall\nSnail mail your complaint if needed.\nDo this until you take to a person\n\nBut also keep in mind that the Dm will probably only answer the phone during office hours (9-5) \n\nAgain. \nI'm sorry that you got sick.\nThere is nothing the store can do.\nThe employees hate their jobs\nHave a nice life.\n\n\n\nEdit: if you have an allergy and didn't tell the employee there is nothing you or anyone else can do.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/PaneraEmployees\/comments\/f9not7\/panera_bread_gave_me_food_poisoning_sent_me_to\/fit94jo\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"PaneraEmployees","reddit_link_id":"t3_f9not7","reddit_parent_id":"t3_f9not7","reddit_submission":"f9not7"},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2020-02-26T04:14:10","reddit_id":"fit7saw","reddit_name":"t1_fit7saw","reddit_created_utc":1582708450,"reddit_author":"shinyspiders","reddit_text":"I felt a little bad but then I read your comments.

I've been working here for almost two years and so far I've seen 4 managers come and go from the time I started. Most of these managers left the store under the guise of \"becoming a full time student\" or \"looking into different careers\". I don't doubt that this was partially the case, but most of them went on the record to say that they were also leaving due do our terrible GM and AM. The stress at this store is crippling, as the Wednesday-Tuesday schedule is rarely out earlier than late Monday night. Admittedly, the GM who was recently doing the schedule had been doing a great job this time around, but that was such a drastic change from their norm that most of the associates have been counting down until things go back to normal. A few days ago I found out that our AM is taking back the schedule, and I'm going to quit if my availability is not respected. To preface this, I've been scheduled against my availability three times now. I'm okay with coming in an hour early to work on the line or get a head start on dishes, but I'd like a dialogue with the scheduling manager. This specific manager scheduled me an hour earlier than my availability allowed in order to have me do PM prep and close down the line. Maybe I should have been more trusting of my fellow associates, specifically the ones on the line, but it felt like a lose-lose situation given that I had to rish to get prep done at 8 pm before everyone on the line started to leave. I haven't seen ANY of our current preppers leave at exactly 8 pm consistently when they arrive at 3 or 4 pm. I always feel stretched thin when I work there, but that's not my biggest issue. One by one everyone that I've worked with has left. We are always hiring, but somehow never get any new line closers. The one that we've received in the past three months has been great, and probably one of the few reasons why I was able to cut my hours down to 15 for school. Back to scheduling, I've told the GM three times now that I can ONLY work a maximum of 15 hours. At breadbash they asked us to write down when we could work and how many hours we wanted. I said 15-18, but mainly emphasized the fact I wanted three shifts. Up until I changed my schedule to be only available three days out of the week, I had been receiving 20 hours a week and four closing shifts in a row. I would message the GM, who I assumed told our AM about it. Two months later the AM asks me if my hours were okay as if that somehow changed the past. I'm all for forgiveness after one or two mistakes, but repeated behavior and manipulation of the schedule to get what you want is something I'm not the biggest fan of. I solemnly swear to quit if the upcoming schedule doesn't respect my availability. I cannot take this anymore given that I'm taking 4 three credit classes that are proving to be a little harder than I anticipated. On a more peraonal note, I'm starting to get tired of recieving no recognition for anything I do. Our GM and AM are the ones who dictate employee of the month and they rarely close. As a closer, I feel underrepresented by our management given that the two managers thag close more than half of the week \"haven't been here long enough\" to be able to have any say in employee of the month. Due to everyone having left because of management or pay (which is an entirely different fiasco given that all these new people get started at 9 an hour and recieve 10 cents for each position they're trained on as opposed to the 8.50 most of us started on with the 25 cent raise for training on either Production of Service, meaning anyone who's been there long enough and not been lucky enough to receive a possible 10 cent raise will never catch up to the newbies.) I am the de facto best closer. I do my job and I do it well, all the while trying to do my best at customer service. The in and out of new faces and lack of appreciation makes this job feel monotonous and always leaves those that are good at the jobs feeling stretched thin due to management thinking they can cut preclosers out of the picture to cut back on hours. Things are bad at this franchise. In short, mids leave without actually stocking because \"we were busy\" and aren't held accountable, management is awful except for a few managers who don't have a say in anything due to their lack of seniority, the schedule is often manipulated to cut the tiniest of corners and save the littlest amount of money on labor as possible, I've trained countless people despite not being a trainer and knowing what all is included in a POF, and overall the few people who are good at their jobs have been stretched thin by the ladder. Every few months I start to reach my breaking point due to the escalation and de-escalation of stress and tension between manager actions and how it affects the work environment. Im nearing it yet again.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/PaneraEmployees\/comments\/f5e0ts\/getting_tired_ranttangent\/","reddit_title":"Getting Tired [Rant\/Tangent]","reddit_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/PaneraEmployees\/comments\/f5e0ts\/getting_tired_ranttangent\/","reddit_subreddit":"PaneraEmployees","reddit_link_id":null,"reddit_parent_id":null,"reddit_submission":null},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2020-02-17T17:34:06","reddit_id":"fhym8ta","reddit_name":"t1_fhym8ta","reddit_created_utc":1581978846,"reddit_author":"shinyspiders","reddit_text":"I think it may be time to put in some applications elsewhere... stay until you find something to jump to, but see what else is out there.

If there are no deliveries on the screen you are expected to help around the cafe. Try to learn dining room and barista as soon as you can.

Tell your GM that since you are trusted enough to train associates that you would like to be signed up for the BTT class. (Build the Trainer). In a perfect cafe, the scheduling manager and GM should be correlating trainers with trainees but it depends on how many trainers you have to start with. I have seen multiple assoc given the opportunity to become a trainer and they have turned it down. \nRemember, it's not the trainees fault that the management may be disorganized and should have a fair chance at being trained correctly, no matter who it's from. \n\nI recently had a trainee who on her first training shift for dish, the dish washer walked out on her because she didn't want to train her and her 2nd shift the cashier refused to show her anything.

And then on top of that he got the bag of chips and an apple. So paying for 1 meal to get essentially 2. And then he would pick out the biggest oatmeal cookie, cut it up into pieces, along with the apple and pour cinnamon and honey on the apple. And he would microwave the 2 on our NON MICROWAVABLE PLATES, and then sit there until around 10:20, when we closed at 10.

In just four weeks and with sometimes no complete training I was expected to bake solo with no supervision or room for error, was chastised for asking questions, and saw constant errors in managment. The schedules would come out the day they go into effect and ask you start commuting in and entirely different direction when I have multiple cafes within 10 minutes of my house. The training baker wouldnt even know sometimes that I was coming to work with them or expect that they were training someone new, one time actually leaving me standing outside for more than half an hour because they we unaware I was even there. In an 8 hour shift if I asked for a break I was met with trouble getting longer than 5 minutes, and dont even think about a lunch. When I brought up my frustrations I was told that all bakers are expected to put up with this sort of stuff and it shouldn't be a problem, that some people just dont have what it takes to do this. What a joke, this isnt heart surgery, it's the McDonald's of bakeries and no one should give everything when you get handed crap in return.  In what world do I need to work for Panera so badly that I'd just shrug aside actual laws put in place to protect workers from this kind of nonsense.

The biggest issue for our market is the managers at our locations (cafe managers, not baker managers) messing with our time stamps.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/PaneraEmployees\/comments\/dt6cfu\/a_serious_warning_to_anyone_wanting_a_new_baking\/f6v17mo\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"PaneraEmployees","reddit_link_id":"t3_dt6cfu","reddit_parent_id":"t3_dt6cfu","reddit_submission":"dt6cfu"},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2019-11-07T21:47:50","reddit_id":"f6vb1yg","reddit_name":"t1_f6vb1yg","reddit_created_utc":1573181270,"reddit_author":"ludyloomy","reddit_text":"I'm not a kid either, never having worked in a kitchen before.

I have been working for panera the franchise for about a year now. I am mainly a closing associate i know all positions except for baker, prep and truck. I do Line mostly and am one of our stores best and quickest closers. I also help with catering alot i deliver catering. But i have alot of friends taht work there and i love working with them ngl we goof off quite a bit. But we always get our work done and in a timely manner. ( im 18btw). I get paid 8.75 a hour ive been trying for a two and half months bow to get a raise to 9$ and ive filled the paper work out and everything but GM of my store keeps \u201cforgetting\u201d to give it to our director. That is the temporary gm while are main one is on maternity leave. Are main one me and her don\u2019t really get along very well. So im trying to get this done before she comes back in a week but i dont see it happening. I was also told i would be put on the track to become a shift manager and that has gone absolutely no where my buddy is in the same boat as me. I always come in when they call me wven when im not scheduled for that day i come in early every time i work ive never been late. Im just tired of this company\u2019s stinjyness. And the. I come to hear that employees that have been working there a shorter amount of tome than me are making a whole dollar more a hour than me pisses me the fuck off. Ive always been good to this company and everytime the company has a chance it turns around and fucks me over im sick of it. Also not to mention McDonalds employees make more money than what im getting as there starting pay. For the most part the shift managers are very nice there is a few i like more than others and a then one that I really dislike but can handle. So to wrap this up if something dosent change soon i will be looking for a new job. \n\nPS: if youve gotten this far thanks for reading my rant.

It started out as almost the perfect job. Loved the people I worked with. We were all really close. Like family. \n\nThe manager staff was great. They were so understanding and willing to go above and beyond to help you. You could go to them with anything and they were always there to listen and help. \n\nBut over time the manager got moved to new stores and we got new ones. Let\u2019s just say the place turned to shit. \n\nWe got a new general manager who was married. You could see she was a bit unhappy but nothing to extreme. She showed favoritism towards employees and gave them special treatment. She even tried to sleep with one of the delivery drivers and wanted to sleep with one that was engaged. She never slept with them but we all know she wanted too.\n\nAnother manager would constantly curves saying f-that and f-this and even f-the kids (meaning all the people in high school that worked there). He would even jokingly sing and say I\u2019m going to bunch you in the face and stuff like that. Like we know it\u2019s a joke but it\u2019s a little off putting.\n\nThis same manager would also talk down to this one kid. He was a bit slow and took him awhile to do stuff because he had some disability\u2019s. Well one of the garbages in the back was about half way full. And it had all the coffee stuff in it so it made it heavy. He started to yell at the poor kid telling him to change it and that it\u2019s not rocket science. The kid being who he is did not understand and said that he knows it\u2019s not rocket science. To then the manager saying that apparently it is and walked away. Like how could you have someone speak to someone that way who has a disability. That\u2019s completely disrespectful. \n\nThen what made me turn around and walk out was that I had a set schedule, this was set before they came. Was set before they all came. Anytime after 10 I could come in. They one day asked me if I could help train someone to put away the truck. I said sure so I started coming in at 730 or 8 on truck days to train the kid. After training him they started to schedule me to do it. I let them know it\u2019s not in my availability. But they still did it anyway.  Then I let them know that I would be dog sitting in about a week and a half and not to schedule me early that I would be like 45 mins away. The new schedule come out and there they have me for truck first thing in the morning. So I go in and let them know that I would not be able to do the first truck shift but I will do the second one. And that I was dog sitting. \n\nI thought it was all taken care of but when I walked in to do the rest of the shift I was scheduled for the manager was waiting for me. And stated to yell at me saying I was supposed to be in at 8 to do truck. I let him know that I was dog sitting and let everyone know that I would not be in early. And thought it was understood. I then asked if he just wanted me to go home (because I did not want to be yelled at all day) and he told me he did not care so I left. \n\nI wound up calling later that day and talked to another manager and he basically just yelled at me the whole time saying it was all my fault. And before I could ask if I\u2019m still working there he hung up the phone.  \n\nThe new manager staff was a bunch of people who did not care about anyone and would talk about people behind there backs. I\u2019m was not the first to leave and I wasn\u2019t the only one who left. More people left after me. They treat their people like crap and don\u2019t care about anyone.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/PaneraEmployees\/comments\/dcf9kd\/my_time_working_at_panera\/","reddit_title":"My time working at Panera","reddit_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/PaneraEmployees\/comments\/dcf9kd\/my_time_working_at_panera\/","reddit_subreddit":"PaneraEmployees","reddit_link_id":null,"reddit_parent_id":null,"reddit_submission":null},{"aware_post_type":"submission","aware_created_ts":"2019-09-23T04:49:33","reddit_id":"d83ttl","reddit_name":"t3_d83ttl","reddit_created_utc":1569228573,"reddit_author":"MissChiliPepper","reddit_text":"I had a girl walk up to the reg, order went smooth but at the end she insisted I give her a 32oz cup for water along side of her 32oz iced tea she just purchased. \"I'm really thirsty\" she said. \"I really can't do that, sorry.

One of my coworkers (also a delivery driver) has been kind of skeeving me out lately. And it kind of seems like might be escalating a little??\nAt first it was just him trying to start awkward conversations with me and I thought nothing really of it\u2014 whatever, some people have a hard time with social interations, I get it. \nBut then he tried asking me out to drinks with some of his friends. I told him that I had recently turned 19 so I couldn\u2019t exactly go to a bar. I also have literally never met any of his friends before so even if I did go I would be going out with strangers. \nWhen I told him this, he then asked me if I wanted to go with him and his friends (again, complete strangers) to New York City for New Years Eve. I told him no, that I wasn\u2019t one for parties and crowds, but then he said he would drag me out with them if he had to. I was getting a little uncomfortable so I laughed and made a joke about me being too short so it probably wouldn\u2019t be any fun anyway and then he said that I \u201ccould sit on his shoulders\u201d. I said no again and just sort of walked away after that. \nThen a few nights ago after delivery shut down for the day, I went to my car and started changing to go meet up with some friends. \nNow, I usually wear thermal leggings and a long sleeved shirt under my work pants and that ugly orange shirt delivery drivers have to wear, so it wasn\u2019t like I was naked or anything (thank god), but when I turned around to get my jacket from the backseat, I saw him walking around in circles really close to my car. \nHe saw me see him and then he turned and walled back to his car\u2014 on the other side of the parking lot. I SWEAR he was watching me change. I got freaked out (obviously) and I left after that. \nThen again today I swear he said \u201csorry beautiful\u201d to me as he moved to get out of my way as I walked past him. I started to tell him to not call me that but all I could manage to say was \u201cdon\u2019t\u201d. \nAfter that, he tried starting conversations with me, but I was still uncomfortable from before and I just gave as short answers as I could to try and shut it down before he could hold me conversationally hostage. \nI honestly don\u2019t know what to do about it, since he hasn\u2019t REALLY done anything but it\u2019s starting to make me really uncomfortable.

Second, it\u2019s okay to say anywhere is fine because this is your first job and it\u2019s nice to learn from your mistakes and at panera, you could get trained on everything depending how long ur going to stay. I don\u2019t want to scare you, but personally working at Panera was one of the harder jobs I worked at because most things there are at high temperatures such as the soups and the oven. I was constantly sweating and really tired after work. \n\nworking on sandwiches isn\u2019t that bad once you get all the recipes down but I would recommend scanning through the menu just to be familiar with it. The most common sandwich you will get is the chipotle chicken avocado. The most annoying thing about making this sandwich is just getting your gloves, dirty from scraping down the avocado. The most easiest sandwich you make will be the grilled cheese. being on sandwich lined is straight to the point and your screen will tell you exactly what Bread sauce and order the ingredients need to go on will be right there in front of you. When you agreed to be a sandwich maker, you\u2019re basically going to be a salad maker and a QC. there are three lines, sandwich, salad, and QC. Personally, I like being placed on salad line because your gloves get less dirty. On the salad line is simple because you just toss the lettuce into a bowl add the dressing, then put the toppings on the salad and you\u2019re done. The one thing that\u2019s hard about the solid line is memorizing the dressings because some look similar. The best advice I received was that the Fuji apple looks like the inside of an apple, so it\u2019s a white color. The easiest salad you\u2019ll make is going to be a Caesar salad. QC is a 50\/50 of easy to being hard. It\u2019s easy when you only have 1-3 orders, but when it gets busy gets a little stressful and hectic. QC is basically organizing the orders and making sure the order has the correct items. Sometimes you even have another person double checking if everything is correct in the bag. \n\nI recently quit my job at panera because of management and the amount of work I had to put into a single job. My legs would be very sore after because most stuff at my panera were on tall shelves, and I had to use my calves most of the time. \n\nbut advice I would give for anyone working anywhere, if you don\u2019t enjoy it and the people there are not worth your time , just quit. I spent way too long at this job being miserable and found a new job that already makes me 10 times happier. I know it\u2019s easier said than done but work should not make you miserable 100% of the time. bc there are those few days that are bad. but most are good when you get to talk to ur coworkers, find cool customers and enjoy the food. so good luck i hope this helps and finds you well !","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/PaneraEmployees\/comments\/14gdngl\/just_got_hired\/jp5qqtv\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"PaneraEmployees","reddit_link_id":"t3_14gdngl","reddit_parent_id":"t3_14gdngl","reddit_submission":"14gdngl"},{"aware_post_type":"comment","aware_created_ts":"2023-06-23T09:53:17","reddit_id":"jp81aga","reddit_name":"t1_jp81aga","reddit_created_utc":1687528397,"reddit_author":"Technowizard1","reddit_text":"Congrats on being hired!!!

One situation I can say that I will never forget happened on a Sunday night sometime last year in October. It had already been a stressful day because we had been busy. I was working drive thru with one of my co-workers and we were putting together an order for this lady. The lady had ordered a bowl of French Onion Soup and a half sandwich of some kind.. so my co-worker had  put everything into a medium bag with the utensil, and everything. Mind you this co-worker had only been working here for at least six months. So they hadn't really experienced any rude or mean customers yet. I had stepped to the side to let them hand it out the window. I thought everything was fine until I heard the knock at the window, my co-worker opened it back up the lady said something along the lines of 'you made me spill my soup all over the passenger seat of my car and now it's ruined' then the lady told my co-worker to get her a new bowl of soup and that we could take back the old one. (but with policy we cannot take back anything, YK... and that's what my co-worker told her.. then this lady proceeds to throw the bowl of soup at the co-worker thru the window.. without the lid on and there is still hot soup inside the bowl.. She then proceeded to not care that we had other people in the drive thru and wouldn't leave. Our manager that night had to call the police to come tell her to move. She almost got arrested I believe because she wasn't listening to the officer either and was being blatantly disrespectful. In the end close to around closing time they finally got her to leave. That was a very interesting Sunday night for sure.

Which I have really amazing Managers and Co-workers and we all get along very well. For Music: The one I work at we are not allowed to listen to music while being on mainline or drive-thru or cashier or Dining room until we close, then we can listen to music while we are closing our section of the store. We can only listen to music while on dishes in BOH (back of house). We cannot have earbuds in because if the manager needs us or something we need to be able to hear them. When I work dishes I bring my own JBL speaker (the one at the store is like never charged) so I can listen to music. My managers don't care what music we listen to as long it is appropriate and minor cusring. Plus they shouldn't be able to hear it up front because of customers.

This step in important for a secure and nice looking wrap]. Then I tuck the sides in keeping the same snug pressure on the wrap and I roll the sandwich up into the top flap and I tape the flap down with a sticker. \n\nFor half sandwiches the process is slightly different in order to get a snug and nice looking wrap. When wrapping a half Sandwich keep the same steps from above but when you go to tuck the sides of the wrapper wrap on side of the wrapper over the sandwich just like you would on a whole sandwich so it's at it's full length [I typically do the right side this way but it doesn't matter] then when you go to wrap the other side of the wrapper, fold the flap in half first before you wrap it onto the sandwich [this is so you don't get a corner of said flap sticking out of the sandwich wrapper when your done, it's to tuck the full wrapper in nicely] and then you can continue wrapping above.\n\nWrapping sandwiches can be relatively easy while looking nice as long as you wrap the wrapper snugly and then adjust the size of the second side flap so it's tucked into the wrapper. The only grief I experience on sandwich is the stickers refusing to stick lol. Good luck and hopefully my ramblings were legible [I wanted to post pictures of my steps but reddit wouldn't allow me to].","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/PaneraEmployees\/comments\/151bq92\/how_do_you_guys_wrap_cold_sandwiches\/js7vbn8\/","reddit_title":null,"reddit_url":null,"reddit_subreddit":"PaneraEmployees","reddit_link_id":"t3_151bq92","reddit_parent_id":"t3_151bq92","reddit_submission":"151bq92"},{"aware_post_type":"submission","aware_created_ts":"2023-07-16T02:05:48","reddit_id":"150ybcp","reddit_name":"t3_150ybcp","reddit_created_utc":1689487548,"reddit_author":"duelmastr23","reddit_text":"After me and my manager both cleaned up, I asked her about the food left on the counter.

It's rare to have a job you enjoy especially in fast\/casual dining but I found much joy in talking to customers and my coworkers and pride for my work ethic. Don't get me wrong, I have been long overdue for a better job but I miss dearly the friends and folks I didn't get a chance to say goodbye to. So let's air some dirty laundry that's been piling up in the two years since the current gm took over. (many of these are my personal experiences with him, I can't speak for the countless other employees harassed by this man) \n\n\u00a0\u00a0 -if he was in a bad mood, he made sure everyone else was. Slamming baker racks and dishes is not a way to coach and lead your store. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0 -publically talking about and listing who his favorite and least favorite employees are (to other employees?????)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 -did I mention I decided to switch from opening for 5 years to closing after they hired a really toxic couple?? I just wanted to avoid the drama and hate they brought to the store everyday. Both were fired a couple months after I switched(one for stealing $8000 from the store and who knows how much from the tips. No charges were pressed, she was just let go.)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 -belittling and berating people constantly either to their face or behind their back. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0 -withheld the opurtunity of heart checks from both my partner and I. When I brought this up to another manager (not thinking she'd say anything about it) she confronted him saying it wasn't fair we weren't being treated the same as all the rest of the team. He responded \"they aren't getting raises anyway. What's the point?\" (yeah, the point of the heart check is not raises. The store gets like $1.75 to use for raises in a team of 30+ people. But I'd like you to tell me to my face what I can be doing better to earn that.)\n\nI had also been informed by other employees that this general manager was telling new hires not to discuss their wage and had some team members share allegations of racism, sexism, and transphobia. I cannot attest to the validity of these claims but knowing the experience I have had with this man, I take them seriously.\n\nI feel disappointed to work for a company for so many years that that would put such a disrespectful person with no integrity in charge of a store. Even for fast\/casual they need to do better and have respect for the people making the profit panera bread does. \n\nEdit! For those wondering, I was fired for wearing out of uniform jeans. I understand I was in the wrong and I don't like making excuses, but they were jeans that I had worn 3 times a week for the past few years. Not once was I told not to wear them, other crew wear ripped jeans and sweatpants all the time, in fact the crew member in the bakery was wearing sweat pants when I got fired and speaking to her after that day, she had no repercussions. The general manager was off that day but watching the cameras at home and saw me in the same thing I've worn for 70% of my career and emailed the manager in charge my termination write up (who was really sad during the whole process, he couldn't even say the words \"you're fired\", I had to ask.) it genuinely felt intentional and targeted.","reddit_permalink":"\/r\/PaneraEmployees\/comments\/16fggtl\/just_a_silly_little_rant\/","reddit_title":"Just a silly little \u2728rant\u2728","reddit_url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/PaneraEmployees\/comments\/16fggtl\/just_a_silly_little_rant\/","reddit_subreddit":"PaneraEmployees","reddit_link_id":null,"reddit_parent_id":null,"reddit_submission":null},{"aware_post_type":"submission","aware_created_ts":"2023-09-09T02:09:29","reddit_id":"16dy3d7","reddit_name":"t3_16dy3d7","reddit_created_utc":1694239769,"reddit_author":"LostSession1311","reddit_text":"My job demoted me from full time to part time today and i\u2019m fucking PISSED.

A lot of times, the day crew runs labor high during the day, and then it is the night crew,  who has to suffer for it. In order to try to get the labor number is back down, some of the night crew are called off or told to go home  early , leaving the remaining workers to deal with the aftermath.\n\nOther times, some calculations have not been added in , such as catering orders have not been finished or closed, or even that there was a little bit of a delay on the update to the numbers,  for whatever reason.\n\nThis could explain how you are -35 and then +18 in a short span of time.  But just being negative 35 is a really good number as well.  It would be worth it to see what might have happened that day to make such a drastic change in the opposite direction.\n\nAnd you are correct, it doesn't matter if you hire 30 new people,  if only four of them are allowed to work at a particular shift.
